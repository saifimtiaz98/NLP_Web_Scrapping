"WHO, Africa CDC support 17 countries to develop mpox vaccination plans",2024-11-09,"WHO, Africa CDC support 17 countries to develop mpox vaccination plans 09 November 2024 Brazzaville – World Health Organization (WHO) and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) experts gathered in Brazzaville this week with country representatives and partners to provide guidance for the development of targeted mpox vaccine preparedness and deployment plans to ensure that available doses are used efficiently.In anticipation of further mpox vaccine deliveries to the African region in the coming months, countries had requested support on identifying and mapping mpox hotspots, areas with high numbers of mpox cases, based on the local epidemiology and the planning of targeted vaccination strategies to reach at risk of mpox populations. “Given the ongoing difficulties with bringing the outbreak under control using traditional public health measures, the need for effective mpox vaccine preparedness and deployment plans has become urgent. With the mpox vaccine supply constraints, countries will need to develop very targeted deployment plans, guided by local epidemiology,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. More than 120 participants from 17 countries along with partners from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Agency for International Development, and with support from Canada participated in the 5 - 7 November 2024 Regional Mpox Vaccine Preparedness and Deployment Plan Development meeting.During the meeting, WHO and Africa CDC experts provided countries with the most up to date information on current WHO recommendations and a set of tools to guide mpox vaccination plan development.Both organizations have made concerted efforts to help countries acquire vaccines amid ongoing outbreaks. WHO added the MVA-BN vaccine to its prequalification list on 13 September 2024; and established an Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM) to facilitate better access to vaccines, treatments and tests where they are most needed. Mpox vaccine deployments were delayed on the continent and the supply is likely to remain limited in the near- to medium-term. However, recently 3 countries in the African Region - Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria received a total of 280 000 doses. Initial vaccination efforts have started in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda and more than 50 000 doses have been administered. ""The swift actions of countries across Africa to roll out targeted mpox vaccination strategies reflect an extraordinary commitment to protect those most vulnerable. Achieving this progress within a short window of time underscores the ambition and resilience of our member states to halt transmission and safeguard at-risk populations. This momentum speaks to the power of collaboration across the continent and with our global partners. Africa CDC remains unwavering in its support, equipping countries with essential tools, guidance, and resources to drive impactful progress in controlling mpox,"" said Dr Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC, Director General. WHO and Africa CDC, and other partners are working together in the Continental IMST to support countries to prepare for and respond to mpox outbreaks, not just through vaccination, but also in areas such as diagnostics, case management, risk communication and community engagement.The collaboration between agencies comes at a critical time, as mpox cases continue to rise on the continent and new cases are reported outside Africa. As of 6 November, more than 11 000 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported since the start of 2024. Four countries (South Africa, Guinea, Cameroon and Gabon) in October 2024 moved to the ‘controlled phase’ after reporting no new cases for six weeks. Fourteen other countries are currently experiencing active outbreaks in Africa. The regional meeting focused on support for the following countries: Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Kenya, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

This joint initiative, with participation from Ghana and other selected African countries, will support capacities for public health emergency preparedness and response by deploying innovative rapid-response health facilities capable of effectively managing high-risk outbreaks.This simulation exercise is part of two initiatives. INITIATE2, co-led by WHO and WFP, bringing together emergency actors, research and academic institutions and countries to design and develop innovative, standardized solutions to improve preparedness and response efforts to health and other humanitarian crises. The initiative also aims to train responders, including through simulation exercises, on the installation and use of these new solutions, contributing to their capacity to quickly kick off operations at the onset of an emergency.Against the backdrop of over 100 public health emergencies every year, WHO, UNICEF and MSF have joined their expertise to develop a child friendly Health Emergency Facility (HEF), which can be rapidly deployed and equipped in the event of future disease outbreaks. HEF prevents disease outbreaks to become pandemics, potentially saving millions of lives.Hosted at the Critical Care and Emergency Hospital, operated by the Ghana Armed Forces (formerly the UN COVID-19 field hospital), this full-scale simulation exercise will test the first solution developed within INITIATE2, an Infectious Disease Treatment Module (IDTM), and Health Emergency Facility (HEF) kits—state-of-the-art treatment and containment solutions developed to rapidly set up essential facilities in remote or crisis-affected areas. This takes away the need to transport individuals over long distances to treatment facilities, with increased risks of spreading the infections and is also aligned with the principle of containment-at-source.Officials from health authorities in Ghana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda together with representatives from the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) will engage with 100 participants from over 20 partner organizations in a realistic Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) outbreak scenario, practicing critical patient care response skills for managing infectious diseases like Ebola and Marburg.Key Objectives of the Simulation ExerciseStrengthening Collaboration and Coordination: Building closer partnerships among health organizations, emergency responders, and military support teams.Hands-On Training with Innovative Solutions: Introducing participants to the IDTM and HEF kits, designed for rapid deployment, to test their practicality in various settings.Comprehensive Case Management: Conducting full patient journey demonstrations, from initial diagnosis and treatment to discharge or dignified care for non-survivors.Media InvitationMedia representatives are invited to observe the opening ceremony on November 11, 2024. Additional opportunities to cover specific demonstration days, including the full outbreak response on November 13 and 14, will showcase key operational scenarios such as patient care, facility management, and rapid scaling of the IDTM and HEF kits.This joint effort highlights WHO, UNICEF, WFP/UNHRD, MSF, and the Ghana Armed Forces’ dedication to bolstering the region's public health resilience.

"African health ministers, delegates adopt declaration on climate change and health",2024-10-31,"African health ministers, delegates adopt declaration on climate change and health 31 October 2024 Harare – Health ministers and delegates from 20 African countries today adopted a landmark declaration to enhance climate resilience within health systems and address the profound health impacts of climate change on the continent.The Harare Declaration, endorsed during the first Climate and Health Africa Conference (CHAC), calls for immediate and collaborative action from a wide array of stakeholders—including governments, academic institutions, funding agencies and civil society—to combat the detrimental health effects of climate change and improve the well-being of African populations.Speaking at the official opening of the conference, President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe said, “Climate change is not merely an environmental disaster. It is a public health emergency and I firmly believe the recommendations from this conference will pave the way for a healthier and more sustainable continent, where no one and no place is left behind”.The declaration which aligns with the newly WHO adopted framework for building climate-resilient and sustainable health systems in the African region, was endorsed by health ministers and representatives from countries engaged in the WHO-led Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health Initiative (ATACH) and over 500 participants at CHAC.“Our region deals with multiple climate-induced emergencies every year. Ensuring health systems resilience is key. I applaud the commitments taken by health policy makers to build climate-resilient health systems that can adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. Africa faces an escalating burden of climate-sensitive diseases, with increasing transmission of vector- and waterborne illnesses. Recent statistics reveal a 14% rise in malaria transmissions in 2023, potentially putting an additional 147-171 million people at risk by 2030. Additionally, 18 African countries reported cholera outbreaks linked to natural disasters, contributing to a staggering 836 600 cases between January 2023 and March 2024, alongside widespread malnutrition and population displacement.Recognizing the disproportionate burden of climate-related health risks faced by African populations, the declaration presents a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges. It emphasizes the need to strengthen research and knowledge generation by investing in studies that assess the specific impacts of climate change on health in Africa and identify effective interventions. Enhancing policy and decision-making is also crucial by integrating climate change considerations into national health policies and strategies to ensure that health is prioritized in climate action plans.The declaration also highlights the importance of improving surveillance and early warning systems to track climate-related health risks, enabling timely and effective responses.Additionally, it calls for building climate-resilient health systems by enhancing the capacity of health infrastructures to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change, including through necessary upgrades and workforce training.During CHAC, the WHO Regional Office for Africa, in collaboration with the Wellcome Trust, hosted a high-level meeting to promote collaboration among health and climate stakeholders. The meeting was an opportunity to evaluate countries implementation of past Conference of the Parties (COP) commitments and define a roadmap for climate and health in Africa.With support from WHO, 29 African countries have joined ATACH, signaling dedication to safeguarding the health and well-being of their population. The WHO-Wellcome Trust side event provided delegates with a platform to discuss actionable strategies for integrating health priorities into global climate frameworks and strengthening inter-ministerial collaboration. The Climate and Health Africa conference is hosted by the Centre for Sexual Health, HIV and AIDS Research (CeSHHAR) Zimbabwe in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Environment, Climate and Wildlife, the Ministry of Health and Child Care and the WHO Regional Office for Africa amongst other partners.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo introduces R21 malaria vaccine,2024-10-31,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo introduces R21 malaria vaccine 31 October 2024 Mbanza-Ngungu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo – The health authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo today introduced the R21 malaria vaccine into the national immunization programme, adding a crucial tool to complement existing malaria control measures to protect and save the lives of young children.With the country having received 693 500 doses of the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended R21 vaccines, the first phase of the rollout was kicked off in Kongo Central province targeting 173 375 children in the province’s 31 health zones. WHO and partners including UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, PATH, Breakthrough Action and SANRU – a national NGO – are supporting the health authorities to ensure effective introduction of the vaccine.“The introduction of the malaria vaccine is an initiative that highlights the importance of combining high-impact strategic interventions to effectively combat malaria,” emphasized Dr Roger Kamba, Minister of Public Health, Hygiene and Social Welfare. I would like to express our sincere thanks to all the partners who have provided considerable support for the introduction of the malaria vaccine into our country's immunization schedule,” added Dr. Kamba.Malaria killed more than 24 000 people and infected over 27 million, mostly children under five years of age, according to the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Social Welfare 2022 report – the most recent data.“The introduction of the malaria vaccine marks a major milestone in the country’s efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of children,” said Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, WHO Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “Together with the ongoing malaria prevention measures, and by collectively implementing all the approaches, we can effectively protect families and our communities from this deadly disease.”Supporting the national health authorities to prepare for the malaria vaccine rollout, WHO has provided technical guidance, health workers have been trained to ensure safe introduction of the vaccine, and public awareness and other communications outreach measures have been established. Administrative, political, religious and community leaders in Kongo Central province have also been sensitized and involved in the preparations to ensure effective ownership of the initiative.“UNICEF is a key partner in the deployment of the malaria vaccine in the DR Congo. Thanks to our technical expertise, we have helped to build the capacity of health actors, developing appropriate management tools, and implementing effective communication strategies to promote vaccination among parents. UNICEF is committed to continuing its efforts to ensure that all Congolese children benefit from this essential protection, in line with the national vaccine roll-out plan,” said Grant Leaity, UNICEF Representative in the DR Congo.The Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes the 15th country on the continent that offer malaria vaccination, widening access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Malaria is a primary cause of illness and death for African children – one child dies from malaria every minute.“We congratulate the Ministry of Health and its partners on this introduction, particularly at a time when the country faces competing health priorities, including the response to Mpox. This development demonstrates the impact of investing in health systems strengthening to ensure countries' capacity to roll out routine immunisation and respond to health emergencies. Together, Gavi and its partners look forward to continuing to build a stronger foundation for the health and well-being of future generations in the DRC,” said Cyril Nogier, Gavi's Senior Country Director for the DRC.The country is intensifying malaria control efforts through an ambitious 2024–2028 National Strategic Plan that aims to protect 80% of at-risk populations through a comprehensive approach combining mass distribution of next-generation insecticide-treated nets, expanded preventive treatments for pregnant women and infants, and a pilot implementation of seasonal malaria chemoprevention.The plan also includes enhanced vector control via indoor residual spraying and larval source management, improved case management with rapid diagnostics and artemisinin-based therapies, strengthened surveillance systems, and robust community engagement. The efforts are supported by multisectoral collaboration between health, environment and education ministries to address this critical public health challenge.A high impact against malaria can be achieved when the malaria vaccines are introduced with a mix of WHO-recommended malaria interventions that are tailored to the local context.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo introduces R21 malaria vaccine,2024-10-31,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo introduces R21 malaria vaccine 31 October 2024 Mbanza-Ngungu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo – The health authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo today introduced the R21 malaria vaccine into the national immunization programme, adding a crucial tool to complement existing malaria control measures to protect and save the lives of young children.With the country having received 693 500 doses of the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended R21 vaccines, the first phase of the rollout was kicked off in Kongo Central province targeting 173 375 children in the province’s 31 health zones. WHO and partners including UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, PATH, Breakthrough Action and SANRU – a national NGO – are supporting the health authorities to ensure effective introduction of the vaccine.“The introduction of the malaria vaccine is an initiative that highlights the importance of combining high-impact strategic interventions to effectively combat malaria,” emphasized Dr Roger Kamba, Minister of Public Health, Hygiene and Social Welfare. I would like to express our sincere thanks to all the partners who have provided considerable support for the introduction of the malaria vaccine into our country's immunization schedule,” added Dr. Kamba.Malaria killed more than 24 000 people and infected over 27 million, mostly children under five years of age, according to the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Social Welfare 2022 report – the most recent data.“The introduction of the malaria vaccine marks a major milestone in the country’s efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of children,” said Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, WHO Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “Together with the ongoing malaria prevention measures, and by collectively implementing all the approaches, we can effectively protect families and our communities from this deadly disease.”Supporting the national health authorities to prepare for the malaria vaccine rollout, WHO has provided technical guidance, health workers have been trained to ensure safe introduction of the vaccine, and public awareness and other communications outreach measures have been established. Administrative, political, religious and community leaders in Kongo Central province have also been sensitized and involved in the preparations to ensure effective ownership of the initiative.“UNICEF is a key partner in the deployment of the malaria vaccine in the DR Congo. Thanks to our technical expertise, we have helped to build the capacity of health actors, developing appropriate management tools, and implementing effective communication strategies to promote vaccination among parents. UNICEF is committed to continuing its efforts to ensure that all Congolese children benefit from this essential protection, in line with the national vaccine roll-out plan,” said Grant Leaity, UNICEF Representative in the DR Congo.The Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes the 15th country on the continent that offer malaria vaccination, widening access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Malaria is a primary cause of illness and death for African children – one child dies from malaria every minute.“We congratulate the Ministry of Health and its partners on this introduction, particularly at a time when the country faces competing health priorities, including the response to Mpox. This development demonstrates the impact of investing in health systems strengthening to ensure countries' capacity to roll out routine immunisation and respond to health emergencies. Together, Gavi and its partners look forward to continuing to build a stronger foundation for the health and well-being of future generations in the DRC,” said Cyril Nogier, Gavi's Senior Country Director for the DRC.The country is intensifying malaria control efforts through an ambitious 2024–2028 National Strategic Plan that aims to protect 80% of at-risk populations through a comprehensive approach combining mass distribution of next-generation insecticide-treated nets, expanded preventive treatments for pregnant women and infants, and a pilot implementation of seasonal malaria chemoprevention.The plan also includes enhanced vector control via indoor residual spraying and larval source management, improved case management with rapid diagnostics and artemisinin-based therapies, strengthened surveillance systems, and robust community engagement. The efforts are supported by multisectoral collaboration between health, environment and education ministries to address this critical public health challenge.A high impact against malaria can be achieved when the malaria vaccines are introduced with a mix of WHO-recommended malaria interventions that are tailored to the local context. WHO is committed to working with countries and partners to support the rollout of malaria vaccines so more children can benefit from this additional malaria prevention tool as rapidly as possible.

"WHO in Africa, WomenLift Health sign pivotal agreement to strengthen women’s leaders...",2024-10-28,"WHO in Africa, WomenLift Health sign pivotal agreement to strengthen women’s leadership in health 28 October 2024 Addis Ababa – World Health Organization (WHO) in the African Region and WomenLift Health today crossed a major milestone, cementing a crucial partnership to bolster investments in women’s leadership in health and promote gender equity in the sector across the region.The two organizations formally signed an agreement to augment the existing women empowerment initiatives at WHO in the African Region that aim to enhance the leadership capacity of mid- to senior-level women leaders as well as to equip them to navigate complex health challenges, foster resilience and strengthen their leadership capacities.The agreement, signed at the opening of a three-day leadership workshop organized for women health leaders in Addis Ababa from 28 – 30 October 2024, stems from the two organizations’ strong commitment to promote women’s leadership in health. Under the Transformation Agenda Initiative, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, committed to building an empowered and motivated workforce, with a special emphasis on fostering the success and development of women in the Organization.WomenLift Health is committed to expanding the power and influence of talented women in global health and catalysing systemic change to achieve gender equality in leadership. It envisions a world where diverse, accomplished leaders come together to transform health outcomes globally.“Promoting women's leadership in health is not only a matter of fairness but also crucial for improving health outcomes in Africa. Women leaders bring invaluable perspectives and experiences to the global health landscape. Through this partnership, we are shaping the future of health in Africa, by empowering women to lead with confidence, vision and purpose,” said Dr Moeti. The workshop provided targeted training, mentorship, and collaborative sessions for mid- and senior-level women professionals across WHO in the African Region. The participants engaged in a diverse range of activities designed to create a cohort of resilient, empowered women leaders, fully equipped to tackle the complex challenges in global health.“Investing in women’s leadership in health shapes not only their individual career trajectory, but also the future of global health. By building a resilient pipeline of skilled women leaders, we’re laying the groundwork for transformative, inclusive leadership and I am delighted to see this come alive though our partnership with WHO in the African Region,” said Dr Norah Obudho, WomenLift Health’s East Africa Director.Under Dr Moeti’s leadership, a series of initiatives have been launched at WHO in the African Region to create an inclusive environment where women leaders can thrive. These include the Africa Women Health Champions initiative; Pathways to Leadership programme for female staff; Women in Leadership Speaker Series; Women in Leadership Masterclass; and the Mwele Malecela mentorship programme for women in neglected tropical diseases.The collaboration with WomenLift Health augments these ongoing initiatives at WHO in the African Region to strengthen women’s leadership in health. Through the workshop more than 30 women leaders will gain essential skills and insights necessary for effective leadership in the health sector. The partnership will also cultivate critical leadership competencies and provide a platform for women to explore personal leadership perspectives, amplify their voice and lead with purpose.“Women are the backbone of the healthcare system, accounting for the majority of the healthcare workforce. Our partnership with WHO in the African Region is an important step forward in investing in women to rise to decision-making roles and ensure, with diversity, we have better health outcomes for our communities,” said Akhona Tshangela, Southern Africa Director at WomenLift Health.Over the past decade, WHO in the African Region has made significant strides in advancing gender equity, achieving a progressive increase in female representation across its workforce. These proactive measures are critical for achieving gender parity in leadership roles and within the broader health sector. However, further dedicated efforts are needed to close the gender equity gap and ensure equal opportunities at all levels. This partnership between WHO in the African Region and WomenLift Health represents a critical step toward advancing these goals.

Chad introduces malaria vaccine in triple-vaccine rollout for children,2024-10-25,"Chad introduces malaria vaccine in triple-vaccine rollout for children 25 October 2024 N’Djamena – Chad today kicked off an ambitious triple vaccine rollout, including the R21 malaria vaccine, marking a significant step forward in its efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of millions of children.Along with the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended R21 malaria vaccine, Chad is simultaneously rolling out PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines, targeting 19.7 million children aged between six months and five years, among them 168 522 (aged between six and 15 months) will receive the malaria vaccine being introduced in 28 priority districts.WHO, together with partners including GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and Gates Foundation, is supporting the triple vaccine rollout in Chad, which has received a total of 157 900 doses of the R21 vaccine.“This is a very important day for Chad and its children. Malaria vaccines are a breakthrough for child health and malaria control, and the scale up of accessibility in Africa will save tens of thousands of young lives every year,” said Dr Anya Blanche-Philomene Malanga, WHO Representative in Chad.Today’s launch brings to 14 the number of countries on the continent that offer malaria vaccination, extending access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Malaria remains endemic in Chad. In 2023 the country recorded about 1.75 million cases of which 36.4% were children under five years of age. A consistent primary health care challenge, malaria cases account for 43% of medical consultations, 36% of hospitalizations and responsible for 30% of hospital deaths, constituting a significant burden to country’s the health system.In preparation for the rollout, WHO, through the Accelerating Malaria Vaccine Introduction and Roll-out in Africa initiative, has supported rigorous, multi-dimensional preparation activities, including the implementation of targeted training of health care staff, and the creation of a multi-channel communication plan to raise public awareness and mobilize stakeholders.An inter-agency coordination committee, chaired by Chad’s Minister of Health, Dr Abdelmadjid Abderahim Mahamat, will coordinate and oversee the initiative in line with the National Development Plan.High-level political will and community demand for malaria vaccines are refocusing attention on the disease, and the notable impact that can be achieved with a strategic combination of interventions for optimal impact.Pilot introductions of the first RTS,S malaria vaccine into routine immunization programmes in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi from 2019, through the WHO-coordinated Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme, significantly reduced child deaths, and increased access to malaria prevention.

WHO strengthens countries capacities to combat diet related Noncommunicable Diseases...,2024-10-18,"WHO strengthens countries capacities to combat diet related Noncommunicable Diseases in Africa 18 October 2024 Kampala, Uganda – The World Health Organization’s Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) has conducted a five-day capacity-building workshop in Uganda from 14-18 October 2024 to empower 40 representatives from government, civil society, and academia from Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Uganda. The goal was to enhance efforts in implementing policies that promote healthier diets and physical activity to prevent obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).The rising rates of obesity and NCDs in the African Region remains a critical public health concern. Efforts to scale up reduction of the risk factors of increased consumption of nutrient poor and energy dense foods and inadequate physical activity have fueled the rise in obesity and related NCDs in the African Region. For instance, between 2000 and 2016, the proportion of overweight and obese adults increased from 28.4% to 41.7%. Furthermore, among children aged 5–19, obesity increased significantly across the continent and by 2016, 28% of obese children worldwide lived in Africa. In 2019, NCDs accounted for 37% of deaths in the region, compared to 24% in 2000.“To combat this growing health crisis, WHO AFRO is committed to supporting Member States in implementing evidence-based policies that promote healthier lifestyles,” said Dr. Charles Njuguna, the Acting WHO Country Representative to Uganda.“The ongoing training, which is part of the Global Regulatory & Fiscal Capacity Building Programme (Global RECAP) aims to strengthen regulatory frameworks, promote evidence-based policies, and support research on NCD prevention.” Dr Laetitia Ouedraogo Nikiema, Regional Advisor, Nutrition and Food Safety.The training is conducted by World Health organization in collaboration with the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) and the International Development Research Center (IDRC), with funding from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the European Union. Participants are engaged in expert-led discussions, country presentations, and group works, addressing key policy areas such as restricting food marketing to children, taxing sugary beverages, front-of-pack nutrition labelling, reformulating products to reduce salt, sugar, and fat, and promoting physical activity in schools and communities.“This event has been highly informative and beneficial. It will greatly assist us in the conceptualization and implementation of the meeting's recommendations on improvement of the Nutrition Environment to inform healthy food choices for the people in Uganda,"" said Mr. Ivan Arinda Kato, Medical Officer NCDs, Ministry of Health.The workshop has enhanced the capacity of participating countries to develop and implement robust regulatory and fiscal policies, equipping them with concrete action plans to strengthen their fight against NCDs. It also fostered regional collaboration and experience-sharing, promoting a unified, multisectoral approach to tackling NCDs in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

WHO Supports Civil Society Organizations to Address Gender-Based Health Inequities t...,2024-10-18,"WHO Supports Civil Society Organizations to Address Gender-Based Health Inequities through Monitoring of Inequalities 18 October 2024 Accra, Ghana - Achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) requires addressing gender inequalities and intersecting key social determinants of health, which deeply drive poor population health outcomes. Bridging health inequality gaps, particularly those related to gender, is essential for ensuring that data is effectively used and that advocacy drives evidence-based actions. This approach is crucial in improving health outcomes for all, leaving no one behind in the pursuit of equitable healthcare.In line with this, the World Health Organization (WHO) Ghana organized a four-day capacity-building workshop for Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to strengthen advocacy for gender equity within Ghana’s health sector. The training falls under the Canada Global Initiative on Vaccine Equity (CanGIVE), funded by the Canadian Government. It was designed to empower CSOs on health inequality monitoring to strengthen their advocacy leadership on addressing barriers in the delivery of health and social care interventions, particularly those stemming from gender inequality and discrimination.Addressing participants at the beginning of the training, the Officer-In-Charge of WHO Ghana, Dr Frank Lule, emphasized the vital role of CSOs in advocating for equitable health services, especially for women and girls, the underserved and marginalized communities. “By empowering CSOs with the knowledge and tools on Health Equity Assessment Toolkits to monitor and address gender-based inequities in health services, we can make significant strides toward achieving universal health coverage and equitable access to healthcare for all,"" he stated.The training workshop, held in Kumasi, brought together CSOs to share experience and knowledge transfer, while enhancing their capacity to develop evidence informed advocacy products using WHO tools to drive dialogue and policy conversations on tackling gender-related barriers in health services. Participants were introduced to WHO’s compliance standards, WHO’s Health Equity Assessment Toolkits, gender, equity & human rights principles, safeguarding to prevent Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Harassment and knowledge production. The workshop also provided a platform for attendees to share their experiences in health advocacy and discuss their efforts to address gender barriers within their communities.Mr. Peter Badimak Yaro, Director of Basic Needs Ghana, reflected on the significance of the training. He said, “This experience has been truly eye-opening. The monitoring exercises have helped us identify who is being left behind and why. With this knowledge, we can advocate for gender-sensitive and inclusive health policies. This tool equips us to better engage with policymakers and drive meaningful change”.Another participant, Mrs Awurabena Guayeba Dadzie from the World Vision Ghana, echoed these sentiments, “The discussions around gender and equity have reinforced our understanding of how deeply-rooted some barriers are in our communities. We are excited to take these learnings forward and incorporate them into our ongoing health interventions”.For Dr Charity Binka of the African Media and Malaria Research Network (AMMREN), the workshop emphasized the importance of partnerships to delivery gender responsive health systems. “One key lesson is the collective power we have to create change. We now have the knowledge and WHO tools to gather and analyze data, but it's essential to strengthen partnerships to promote gender equity and ensure healthcare services reach everyone.” she stated. Sustained collaboration with Civil Society remains key to removing barriers that prevent equitable access to health services for all. WHO remain committed to working with and facilitating partnerships towards mainstreaming gender, equity and inclusive strategies. Together, we can ensure that everyone has access to the universal, equitable healthcare they deserve.

Sustained collaboration with Civil Society remains key to removing barriers that prevent equitable access to health services for all. WHO remain committed to working with and facilitating partnerships towards mainstreaming gender, equity and inclusive strategies. Together, we can ensure that everyone has access to the universal, equitable healthcare they deserve.

Senegal becomes first African country to establish emergency medical team following ...,2024-10-15,"Senegal becomes first African country to establish emergency medical team following WHO standards 15 October 2024 Dakar – Senegal has become the first country in Africa to receive World Health Organization (WHO) classification for developing the capacity of its emergency medical team to be able to deploy and respond to health crises around the world, marking an historic milestone for the country and significantly boosting the African Region’s emergency response capacity.The classification of Senegal’s Type 2 Emergency Medical Team (EMT) follows the international EMT standards. The country’s EMT is now deployable within 72 hours to autonomously provide medical and surgical care to up to 2500 patients impacted by health emergencies for a four-week period across the globe, follows a rigorous six-year process. EMT2 Senegal is the 49th classified team globally, with 130 others in process around the world.“This certification is a real turning point that reflects the dedication of Senegal’s health authorities to ensuring a coordinated and rapid response to emergencies, both nationally and internationally, consolidating our position as a leader in health crisis management in Africa and beyond,” said Dr Ibrahima Sy, Senegal’s Minister of Health and Social Action, at the certification ceremony.Since 2017, WHO in the African Region has provided intensive technical and financial support to the country, working closely with the Ministry of Health and Social Action, the Health Emergency Operations Centre, and Senegal’s Armed Forces Health Service. During this time, Senegal has already deployed teams to respond to health crises in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and, most recently, Guinea. The recent establishment of the WHO Regional Emergency Hub has been instrumental in accelerating the finalization of certification process of the Senegal EMT. “Congratulations to Senegal for this milestone achievement that contributes significantly to the region’s growing expertise in addressing public health emergencies,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Emergency medical teams are a crucial set of health workforce that greatly enhances the capacity of national health systems through rapid action to save lives in times of crises.”EMTs can provide routine outpatient care, manage emergency and trauma cases, manage mass casualty incidents, outbreaks due to infectious diseases, and safely stabilize and refer patients for higher level care. In addition to clinical expertise, EMT team members are trained to work in the most challenging conditions, establishing field hospitals that are fully self-contained, limiting demands on local resources that may already be stretched in an emergency context.The main aim of the EMT classification, which is overseen by WHO’s EMT Secretariat, is to improve the quality of care and professionalism of medical teams responding to disasters, conflicts, outbreaks and other emergencies. Populations benefit from the rapid arrival of well-trained EMTs, who support existing medical staff.The classification is part of the wider vision encompassed in WHO’s Emergency Medical Teams 2030 strategy. This envisions a world in which every country can respond rapidly and effectively to national emergencies, leveraging regional and sub-regional capacities to support vulnerable communities and others in need.

"Promising progress on eye health in African region, but challenges remain",2024-10-10,"Promising progress on eye health in African region, but challenges remain 10 October 2024 Brazzaville – Despite important progress towards integrating eye health into primary health care services in African countries, a dire shortage of financial resources, combined with the concentration of scarce human resources in urban areas and low community awareness, continues to threaten the gains.One in every six blind people globally live in Africa, along with 26 million others grappling with some degree of visual impairment. Yet statistics show that despite the onerous burden, only 14% of people who need cataract surgery receive it, while more than 80% of people with shortsightedness receive no treatment. The comparative figure for North America, Australasia, western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, meanwhile, is lower than 10%.In addition, only 12% of people in Africa who need glasses or surgical interventions to address blurred vision will receive the necessary care, at significant economic cost to countries. The global estimated costs of uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts is US$14.3 billion annually.World Health Organization (WHO) in the African Region is recording a decrease in vision loss due to Vitamin A deficiency, onchocerciasis and trachoma, but emerging eye health challenges are rising. These are related to ageing populations, unhealthy lifestyles, and noncommunicable diseases.“The focus on eye care is critical, given the multiple positive impacts of good vision on all aspects of life, from overall well-being to academic achievements. The contribution to economic growth is also significant, raising the urgency of building on the gains already made, while addressing the emerging challenges,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, on World Sight Day today.WHO’s current focus in the region is to support countries to integrate eye health services at primary care level, as part of universal health coverage. However, with severely limited human resources, the achievement of Integrated People-Centred Eye Care demands innovative interventions, dedicated community engagement, and cross-sectoral coordination of services.Over the past two years, WHO has provided technical support to six African countries, including Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and Zambia. The work began with the completion of national situational analyses, followed by the development of strategic plans and monitoring frameworks. Operational planning and costing of interventions and resources was also completed, specifically in relation to workforce needs, and the integration of eye care indicators into existing health information systems frameworks.To support countries towards the achievement of the global target of increasing the number of people with access to appropriate spectacles (known as effective coverage of refractive error or eREC) to 40% by 2030, WHO launched the SPECS 2030 initiative. Still in its initial stages, Liberia and Mozambique have begun implementation.Meanwhile, WHO also launched a free self-assessment tool designed to support countries to promote healthy habits and raise eye care awareness. Launched last year, the WHOeyes tool, available in multiple languages, is u used to check visual acuity, while also providing educational messaging.Other support has included the dissemination of strategic documents such as the World report on vision, which outlines WHO’s recommendations for integrated, people-centred eye care, and the launch of the WHO’s Eye Care in Health Systems: Guide for action.

Urgent action needed to accelerate mental health progress in African region,2024-10-10,"Urgent action needed to accelerate mental health progress in African region 10 October 2024 Brazzaville – The African region has made progress over the past decade to strengthen mental health systems, including investments to improve care, health workforce as well as national policies to steer the delivery of vital services. However, the pace of the progress is slow and further efforts are needed to address mental health challenges and ensure well-being.Notable advancements in the region include a 14% improvement in the ratio of mental health specialists to population in the six years to 2020, as well as the introduction of mental health care training for primary health care workers in 79% of African region countries as of2020. Government expenditure on mental health in the region has also increased, from US$0.1 to US$0.46 per capita between 2014 and 2020.In addition, 28% of countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region have integrated mental health and psychosocial support into their preparedness plans for future health crises, while three-quarters have a national mental health policy, and 57% have mental health laws compliant with international human rights instruments – up from 31% in 2014.Despite the progress, challenges remain in provide adequate health care services and programmes for mental, neurological and substance use. The challenges include poor awareness, stigma around mental health; limited structured financial investment to address mental, neurological and substance use problems; as well as ineffective integration of mental health into primary health care. Others are poor multisectoral collaboration to address psychosocial risks and drivers of mental ill health and weak mental health information systems and limited mental health research in the region.“Although countries are making positive steps forward to address mental health challenges, urgent action is needed to acceleration action to better protect and promote mental health,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “We’re working closely with countries strengthen action for comprehensive response to mental health and enable transformation towards better mental health for all.”This year, World Mental Health Day is being marked under the theme “Mental Health at Work” to highlight the vital connection between mental health and work. Social determinants of health such as work-related stress from discrimination, poor renumeration, harassment and bullying, and feeling a lack of control or autonomy can pose a risk to mental health.Only eight of the 47 countries in the WHO African Region have work-related mental health prevention and promotion programmes in place and only three have active collaboration between government mental health services and ministries or departments of labour/employment.To improve access to services, WHO is supporting countries to decentralize and integrate mental health at the primary health care level and integrate mental health into other health services such as early childhood development programme, which is currently being rolled out in Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania. The Organization is also working with governments to adopt rights-based approach to mental health policy, with Ghana and Zimbabwe already implementing the programme. A joint WHO-UNICEF child and adolescent health is also being rolled out in Cote d’Ivoire and Mozambique.Governments are also taking initiatives to strengthen mental health services. In 2022, African countries endorsed the Regional Framework to Strengthen the Implementation of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013 to 2030 in the African Region in which they called for investment in multisectoral coordination, collaboration and partnerships for mental health (including with workers, their representative and employers); aggressive evidenced-based suicide prevention; fighting stigma; adopt policies and legislative reform in line with international human rights standards among other measures to comprehensively address mental health challenges.

Burden of hearing loss in Africa could rise to 54 million by 2030: WHO report,2024-10-07,"Burden of hearing loss in Africa could rise to 54 million by 2030: WHO report 07 October 2024 Brazzaville – About 40 million people live with hearing loss in the African region, but the figure could rise to 54 million by 2030 if urgent measures are not take to address the problem, according to a new World Health Organization (WHO) report.Hearing loss has profound impact on human lives and economies, costing Africa US$ 27 billion annually, according to the Status Report on ear and hearing care in the WHO African Region, launched today during the African Summit on Hearing Impairment in Nairobi, Kenya.Without urgent interventions, widespread hearing loss, which disproportionately affects poor and vulnerable populations, will continue to escalate, amplifying existing inequalities in health services access across Africa.For children, the far-reaching consequences of hearing loss include delays in language development, raising the risk of poor educational outcomes and limited future career prospects. Adults with untreated hearing loss often face isolation, loneliness and an increased risk for depression and dementia.The report identifies multiple factors driving the surge in prevalence of hearing loss in the African region. Primary among these is an acute shortage of ear and hearing care (EHC) specialists, as well as maldistribution of available workforce to the advantage of urban areas. More than 56% of African countries, for example, have only a single ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for every million people. In comparison, the European region has about 50 for every million people.More than three-quarters of African countries, meanwhile, have fewer than one audiologist and one speech and language therapist for every one million people. In addition, although 33 million Africans could benefit from a hearing aid, only about 10% have access due to lack of EHC financing, and consequent high costs.Data from 43 African countries show that while 36 countries provide EHC services at the tertiary level, similar services are not offered at primary care level. This is despite the fact that the common causes of hearing loss are mostly preventable through simple public health interventions, or measures to mitigate the risk factors.Among children living in low- and middle-income countries, the report said, up to 75% of hearing loss is due to preventable causes such as infections and common ear diseases as well as birth complications. Yet, the analysis found that most countries do not routinely conduct hearing screening of newborns.Even in countries with EHC programmes, EHC interventions are not integrated into such priority health programmes as school health programme, and occupational health or healthy ageing programme. This challenge, the authors said, was compounded by the lack of national policies and plans for strengthening delivery of EHC, and low implementation levels even where these plans exist. In addition, 35% of countries do not have a budget allocated to EHC activities, with patients having to bear the entire cost of any related treatment and care.Among other things, the report recommends that countries leverage the report to galvanize action at the highest level, including advocating for policies focused on EHC and related activities. EHC should also be urgently integrated into existing programmes to optimize use of scarce resources. public-private partnerships should be explored by governments towards strengthening EHC services.The report also highlighted the need for dedicated financing for EHC, to equip facilities and deliver products and technologies, and to optimize EHC research and development and health workforce capacity strengthening.

Health labour market analysis support tool launched,2024-10-07,"Health labour market analysis support tool launched 07 October 2024 Nairobi, Kenya – The World Health Organization, Regional Office for Africa launched the Health Labour Market Analysis (HLMA) Support Tool to assist countries assess their health workforce education capacity, supply, demand and need for health workers and facilitate integrating health workforce planning into Health Labour Marker Analysis.The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021 developed the Health Labour Market Analysis Guidebook, trained 75 experts from 25 countries in Africa. Building on this, the WHO designed a HLMA Support Tool which offers a novel workforce planning approach to estimate the needed health workers to address the disease burden of a country or geographical areas based on the essential service packages and the professional standards of care.Following the launch, the WHO will build the capacity of about 50 international experts on the technical and practical aspects of conducting an epidemiology-based health workforce needs assessment and projections. The training component of the capacity building exercises is scheduled to hold from the 7th to 11th of October 2024 in Nairobi Kenya. This comes at a time when Member States are increasingly adopting this epidemiological approach to assess the need for health workers, to inform health workforce policy, strategy and investment plan development. The experts will contribute to a pool of regional experts that will support the growing number of Member States requesting for technical support.Whilst launching the Tool and officially opening the training, Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, the WHO Representative in Kenya, emphasised that stimulating adequate and sustainable investment in the health workforce requires comprehensive insights into past and present health workforce dynamics and future projections under different scenarios, and that the HLMA Support Tool, which has already been used by 12 countries, is critical in achieving that outcome.“The HLMA Support Tool allows users to assess education capacity, health workforce supply, demand and needs, and identify investment requirements for employment. I encourage you to fully engage in this training and build your capacity to support countries in conducting robust health labour market analyses” he stated.Despite ongoing progress in developing the health workforce in the African region over the past few decades, projections indicate a potential shortfall of 6.1 million health workers by 2030, which is necessary to effectively tackle the Region's disease burden through comprehensive health promotion, disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliation.Also, nearly 27% of the trained health workers remain unemployed, underscoring a mismatch between training outputs and actual job creation. This gap requires a 43% increase in current funding levels dedicated to health workforce employment. A health labour market analysis, already conducted in 22 countries, is critical to stimulating policy reforms and investments to address these challenges.The experts, after attending the workshop, are expected to apply the tool in support of Member States that request technical assistance related to health labour market analysis and will champion the generation of evidence needed to inform health workforce investment plans and compacts. These are critical milestones in the implementation of the Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter which was launched in May 2024.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo kicks off mpox vaccination ,2024-10-05,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo kicks off mpox vaccination 05 October 2024 Kinshasa – The Democratic Republic of the Congo today kicked off mpox vaccination, adding a vital measure to complement the ongoing outbreak control efforts to halt the spread of the viral disease and save lives. The vaccination, launched in the eastern North Kivu province, will prioritize health workers and frontline responders, contacts of confirmed cases, contacts of those contacts, and other at-risk groups. The vaccination will subsequently be rolled out in 11 of the most affected health zones in Equateur, North Kivu, Sankuru, South Kivu, Sud-Ubangi and Tshopo provinces.The Democratic Republic of Congo has received 265 000 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine donated by the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the United States Government.“As we rally efforts to stop the mpox outbreak, the rollout of the vaccine marks an important step in limiting the spread of the virus and ensuring the safety of families and communities,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Vaccines are an important additional tool in outbreak control and we’re grateful to our partners who have donated the doses. We’re working closely with the national authorities to effectively deliver the vaccines to those who need them most.”WHO recommends that vaccination be implemented as part of a comprehensive response that includes enhanced surveillance, community engagement, contact tracing, public health and social measures, and appropriate case management. WHO and partners are working closely with the national authorities to scale up and reinforce all the key control measures to save lives and end the outbreak. To further strengthen the ongoing outbreak response, more than 300 WHO experts supporting polio eradication efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been integrated in the mpox response. The experts have extensive field experience in public health, particularly in community-based and health-facility active surveillance, case investigations, contact tracing and risk communication, and have been at the forefront in the fight against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. In preparations for the mpox vaccination, WHO has supported the national health authorities in a range of areas, including training of health workers; enhancing vaccine delivery systems and infrastructure such as vaccine storage and transportation; community engagement; as well as ensuring supervision and evaluation of the process for quality vaccine delivery. Efforts are also ongoing to reinforce measures to identify and address vaccine mis- and disinformation and engage with community and religious leaders to increase access to accurate information. Mpox vaccines are currently in short supply, especially in Africa. In September 2024, WHO added the MVA-BN as the first mpox vaccine to its prequalification list, a step that is expected to facilitate timely and increased access to this vital product in communities with urgent need, to reduce transmission and help contain the outbreak.WHO is working with partners, including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and UNICEF, to establish a distribution mechanism for doses being donated by other countries as well as from direct procurements from the vaccine manufacturer.The Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported more than 30 000 suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases, and 990 deaths since the start of 2024 – accounting for 90% of the cases reported from 15 countries in the African region so far this year.

"Rwanda reports first-ever Marburg virus disease outbreak, with 26 cases confirmed",2024-09-28,"Rwanda reports first-ever Marburg virus disease outbreak, with 26 cases confirmed 28 September 2024 Brazzaville/Kigali – Rwandan health authorities are intensifying outbreak control efforts following the detection of Marburg virus disease, with 26 cases confirmed and six deaths reported currently.Cases of the virus have been reported in seven of the country’s 30 districts. Twenty cases are in isolation and receiving treatment, while 161 people who came into contact with the reported cases have so far been identified and are being monitored as the authorities ramp up comprehensive response measures and deepen investigation to determine the origin of the infection.In support of the ongoing efforts, World Health Organization (WHO) is mobilizing expertise, outbreak response tools, including emergency medical supplies to help reinforce the control measures being rolled out to curb the virus. A consignment of clinical care and infection prevention and control supplies is being readied and will be delivered to Kigali in the coming days from WHO’s Emergency Response Hub in Nairobi, Kenya. “We’re rapidly setting all the critical outbreak response aspects in motion to support Rwanda halt the spread of this virus swiftly and effectively,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “With the country’s already robust public health emergency response system, WHO is collaborating closely with the national authorities to provide the needed support to further enhance the ongoing efforts.”WHO is also coordinating efforts to reinforce collaborative cross-border measures for readiness and response in countries neighbouring Rwanda to ensure timely detection and control of the virus to avert further spread. Although there are several promising candidate medical countermeasures that are progressing through clinical development, there is no licensed vaccine currently available to effectively combat Marburg virus disease. WHO is coordinating a consortium of experts to promote preclinical and clinical development of vaccines and therapeutics against Marburg virus disease.Marburg virus disease is highly virulent and causes haemorrhagic fever, with a fatality ratio of up to 88%. It is in the same family as the virus that causes Ebola virus disease. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic symptoms within seven days. The virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, surfaces and materials.

Experts commit to step up immunization programme in Central Africa,2024-09-27,"Experts commit to step up immunization programme in Central Africa 27 September 2024 Kinshasa – At their 2024 meeting in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo from 9 to 12 September, Essential Programme on Immunization (EPI) managers from Central African countries committed to consolidate gains made by the EPI in its 50 years of existence.The meeting, which brought together EPI Managers from Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe was aimed at celebrating the achievements of EPI in the last 50 year of saving lives from vaccine preventable diseases. The Secretary General of from the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Ministry of Health, Dr Sylvain Yuma commended stakeholders in EPI for the achievements over the years and highlighted the important role of collaboration among communities, healthcare workers and other actors in the success of the program.“This celebration is an opportunity to recognize the decisive contribution of health workers at all levels, community health workers, political and community leaders in the implementation of immunization programmes, and in the successes that we are going to celebrate this evening. Without community involvement, it would not have been possible to combat vaccine hesitancy, to vaccinate hard-to-reach populations, and to maintain the provision of immunization services during humanitarian crises and, in conflict zones,” said Dr Sylvain Yuma.Through EPI, Central African countries have made progress in the fight against vaccine preventable diseases. The sub region has eradicated wild poliovirus and 8 out of 10 countries have achieved maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination. However, since 2019, the immunization coverage in the Central African sub-region has stalled due to the impact of the COVID19 pandemic and other factors, with over 13 million zero-dose and under-immunized children being recorded from 2019 to 2023. These gaps have left children vulnerable to vaccine preventable diseases, with the sub region recording 9280 cases and 144 deaths from measles outbreaks between January and July 2024.Therefore, the meeting afforded the directors an opportunity to review status of immunization and discussed ways of strategizing to improve coverage and the gains made by EPI in Central Africa.“Catching up with the vaccination of millions of children who missed all or part of the vaccines in the national schedule because of the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered as a top priority for EPI in the African region. Successful implementation of the Big Catch-Up Initiative is our only chance of rapidly reducing the immunity gap inherited from the pandemic,” said Dr Matsidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.Some of the outcomes of the meeting include the need to address gender and access gaps in immunization programming and promote equitable access to vaccines and leave no one vulnerable to vaccine preventable diseases. Furthermore, the EPI Managers resolved to strengthen coordination among countries and with partners to facilitate knowledge sharing and unlock funding opportunities to improve immunization service delivery across the sub region.“Vaccines not only improve public health, but also school performance, household income and economic growth. Every dollar invested in immunization brings a return of US$ 48. It is possible to save more lives through vaccination. UNICEF reiterates its commitment to guarantee the right to immunization and health for every child and every population in West and Central Africa,” said Mr Gilles Fagninou, UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa.The EPI was launched in 1974 by the World Health Organization, to establish equal access to life-saving vaccination for children across all geographical locations and socioeconomic status. It is estimated that vaccination has accounted for 40% of the observed decline in global infant mortality, and 52% in the African region. The establishment of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in 2000 gave new impetus to EPI by increasing access to sustainable resources to fund immunisation services, strengthening health systems, and supporting the introduction of new vaccines, particularly in low-income countries like most Central African countries. “This year, we have seen two malaria vaccines being introduced, especially in Africa. I want to recognize the great contribution of African communities and scientists to successful to the process that led to successful rollout of these vaccine. Reaching one billion children with lifesaving vaccines over the next decade is a goal that I am convinced we will achieve,” said Dr Thabani Maphosa, Chief Country Delivery Officer at Gavi.

Joint statement: World Rabies Day,2024-09-27,"Joint statement: World Rabies Day 27 September 2024 As we commemorate the eighteenth World Rabies Day on 28 September 2024, the Quadripartite agencies (FAO, UNEP, WHO, and WOAH) and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC), in the Africa region, are calling on all stakeholders to reflect on the annual theme for 2024, which is, ""Breaking Rabies Boundaries.""Rabies continues to take lives and cause suffering among both humans and animals, The disease continues to be a life threat, especially in Africa, where the disease is endemic in almost all countries despite the availability of effective preventive measures.Hence, this year’s theme reflects the urgent need to transcend the barriers that hinder rabies elimination across the world. As we aim to move beyond the status quo, this year’s theme acknowledges not only the obstacles within our control but also the transboundary nature of rabies itself.We recognize that achieving our target of Zero by 2030, in line with the ‘Zero by 30 Global Strategic Plan for the elimination of human deaths from dog-mediated rabies’ requires breaking several boundaries, including among others:Promoting One Health Collaboration: Rabies elimination requires a One Health approach, bringing together human, animal, and environmental health sectors for coordinated, collaborative action. The disease persists due to gaps in collaboration between stakeholders. The Quadripartite Organizations and GARC collectively call for all countries to embrace the One Health approach in rabies control, ensuring that no stakeholder is left behind. Enhancing Cooperation: Local, national, and international cooperation is vital. This year’s World Rabies Day events will be an opportunity for stakeholders across all levels to deepen their cooperation. This epitomizes the African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”Breaking Siloes: We must align efforts with the Zero by 30 Global Strategy for Elimination of human deaths from dog-mediated rabies, the Quadripartite Joint Plan of Action, the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap, and other relevant frameworks, to build capacity through rabies elimination efforts that help us to tackle multiple other diseases and enhance our overall health systems. Fostering Innovation: We must adopt novel tools and strategies that will improve rabies prevention and control efforts at local, national, regional, and international levels. The adoption of relevant tools will enable countries to make data-driven decisions and policies in addition to monitoring and measuring the impact of interventions. Scaling up Vaccination programs: Breaking the boundaries that limit programmatic scale-up will allow us to ensure wider and more effective rabies vaccination campaigns, in both humans and animals. For example, mass dog vaccinations supported by the WOAH vaccine bank in several countries in Africa and FAO's support to strengthen animal systems in nearly all countries in Africa, have demonstrated how community-driven programs can be scaled for broader impact. The gains on mass dog vaccination could be immensely scaled up by coupling with access to human Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), through the GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, co-financing policy, as part of routine immunization.

Joint statement: World Rabies Day,2024-09-27,"Joint statement: World Rabies Day 27 September 2024 As we commemorate the eighteenth World Rabies Day on 28 September 2024, the Quadripartite agencies (FAO, UNEP, WHO, and WOAH) and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC), in the Africa region, are calling on all stakeholders to reflect on the annual theme for 2024, which is, ""Breaking Rabies Boundaries.""Rabies continues to take lives and cause suffering among both humans and animals, The disease continues to be a life threat, especially in Africa, where the disease is endemic in almost all countries despite the availability of effective preventive measures.Hence, this year’s theme reflects the urgent need to transcend the barriers that hinder rabies elimination across the world. As we aim to move beyond the status quo, this year’s theme acknowledges not only the obstacles within our control but also the transboundary nature of rabies itself.We recognize that achieving our target of Zero by 2030, in line with the ‘Zero by 30 Global Strategic Plan for the elimination of human deaths from dog-mediated rabies’ requires breaking several boundaries, including among others:Promoting One Health Collaboration: Rabies elimination requires a One Health approach, bringing together human, animal, and environmental health sectors for coordinated, collaborative action. The disease persists due to gaps in collaboration between stakeholders. The Quadripartite Organizations and GARC collectively call for all countries to embrace the One Health approach in rabies control, ensuring that no stakeholder is left behind. Enhancing Cooperation: Local, national, and international cooperation is vital. This year’s World Rabies Day events will be an opportunity for stakeholders across all levels to deepen their cooperation. This epitomizes the African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”Breaking Siloes: We must align efforts with the Zero by 30 Global Strategy for Elimination of human deaths from dog-mediated rabies, the Quadripartite Joint Plan of Action, the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap, and other relevant frameworks, to build capacity through rabies elimination efforts that help us to tackle multiple other diseases and enhance our overall health systems. Fostering Innovation: We must adopt novel tools and strategies that will improve rabies prevention and control efforts at local, national, regional, and international levels. The adoption of relevant tools will enable countries to make data-driven decisions and policies in addition to monitoring and measuring the impact of interventions. Scaling up Vaccination programs: Breaking the boundaries that limit programmatic scale-up will allow us to ensure wider and more effective rabies vaccination campaigns, in both humans and animals. For example, mass dog vaccinations supported by the WOAH vaccine bank in several countries in Africa and FAO's support to strengthen animal systems in nearly all countries in Africa, have demonstrated how community-driven programs can be scaled for broader impact. The gains on mass dog vaccination could be immensely scaled up by coupling with access to human Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), through the GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, co-financing policy, as part of routine immunization. Increasing Disease Awareness: Acknowledging the importance of communities as a key stakeholder in rabies elimination, the Quadripartite Organizations and GARC are calling for countries to scale up community engagement and education as a key element of rabies elimination. By fostering community engagement and support, the barriers of lack of knowledge, misinformation, and misconception on rabies prevention will be bridged. As we look forward to World Rabies Day 2024, we urge individuals, communities, organizations, and governments to take part in activities ranging from mass vaccination campaigns to educational events. By uniting our efforts, we can break these boundaries and achieve a rabies-free world.Let’s make World Rabies Day 2024 a powerful moment in our journey towards ending this preventable disease once and for all.Together, we can break rabies boundaries and make history.

Experts agree on African regional plan for health and climate change ,2024-09-26,"Experts agree on African regional plan for health and climate change 26 September 2024 Dakar — More than 80 health and climate change experts, partners and civil society representatives today agreed on a five-year strategic plan for the African region to support countries build resilient and sustainable health system and make health an integral part of negotiations on climate-change adaptation and mitigation.Meeting in Senegal from 24 to 26 September 2024 for the Fifth Clim-HEALTH Africa meeting. The experts also set in motion discussions and collaborations aimed at driving bold climate actions to address Africa’s climate-induced health challenges. Clim-HEALTH Africa is a consortium for Climate and Health bringing together African technical institutions and international partners to guide and strengthen the public health resilience of African countries and communities to climate change. The network has been working with partners to help predict, prevent, and manage acute public health effects of climate change in Africa through evidence-based climate-informed planning, capacity building and expert knowledge sharing.African countries are experiencing increasing climate-linked emergencies. In 2023 alone, extreme weather events killed more than 15 000 people, with droughts affecting more than 88 million people across six African countries, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data. However, only 22 countries in the region have national health adaptation plans and less than 20% of the countries have health mentioned in their nationally determined contributions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. “Our region is home to six countries of the top ten most disaster affected countries in the world, with heatwaves, floods, cyclones and wildfires affecting health and livelihoods of millions of people,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. The finalization of a Clim-HEALTH Africa strategic work plan comes at a time when health is receiving increasing attention in the global discourse on climate change. The plan marks an important step in the continent’s climate change advocacy drive, as it clearly defines how countries can develop national health adaptation plans, integrate climate change and health challenges into national programmes. The plan also ensures the availability of climate and health indicators that will address issues of early warning systems. With the growing need for countries to have climate-resilient health systems that can adapt to emerging threats, while continuing to meet existing health needs, knowing how to optimize resources remains key. The Clim-HEALTH Africa meeting was an opportunity to strengthen experts’ capacities in climate negotiations in the bid to raise the voice of health in international climate debates. This meeting organized with support from Wellcome Trust and Spanish Government Agency, builds on Clim-HEALTH Africa’s past four gatherings. In 2017, a roundtable of Clim-Health Africa consortium-initiated discussions around using early warning systems for climate-sensitive diseases. A system which has so far been implemented in three pilot African countries to anticipate and rapidly control some infectious diseases like malaria. The key shifts highlighted in this year’s meeting include a focus on setting up a coordination mechanism for contributing to global climate and health indicators work programme, building Africa health negotiators’ capacities in climate diplomacy and negotiations and planning for Clim-HEALTH Africa five years activities’ agenda.“The African regional plan lays a strong foundation for concrete steps that countries can take to address these challenges, assert Africa’s health voice in climate change forums and be resilient in the face of these emerging challenges,” said Dr Moeti.

"WHO in Africa, IFRC bolster partnership for enhanced public health emergency respons...",2024-09-24,"WHO in Africa, IFRC bolster partnership for enhanced public health emergency response 24 September 2024 Brazzaville/Kinshasa - World Health Organization (WHO) in the African Region and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have endorsed a regional collaboration framework to strengthen public health emergency response, especially at the community level, and bolster health security.With the WHO in the African Region’s presence in 47 countries and the IFRC's Africa Regional Office’s support of 49 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in sub-Saharan Africa as well as over 1.4 million volunteers and 12 000 branches, the two organizations are leveraging their vast networks and presence on the continent to support governments in scaling up response at the community level.To address the ongoing mpox outbreak, WHO in the African Region and IFRC are reinforcing their long-standing collaboration to support Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to ramp up measures for an effective response to halt the outbreak. The collaboration can be expanded to include other countries facing active mpox cases, as well as other public health emergencies.“As the continent and the world face new and emerging threats, our enduring partnership remains crucial in safeguarding health, enhancing emergency preparedness, and building a healthier, more resilient Africa,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.WHO and IFRC have collaborated for decades on the continent, driven by a deep-rooted commitment to save lives. The new collaboration framework will facilitate closer coordination and alignment in the response to health emergencies in Africa. It aims to enhance capacity-building in national health workforces, strengthen disaster preparedness and risk reduction, increase vaccine access and expand evidence-based action. The partnership will also streamline and integrate preparedness approaches within ministries of health and address the health impacts of climate change, among other priority areas for collaborative action across the continent.Approximately 500 000 IFRC volunteers are in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that accounts for 90% of all mpox cases in Africa. They have been trained in community-based surveillance, community engagement, risk communication and case management. “Our volunteers are members of the community who have built social trust over many years. They generate large reservoirs of applied research and data on the health status of communities,” said Mohammed Omer Mukhier-Abuzein, IFRC Regional Director for Africa. With an estimated ratio of one volunteer for every 200 people living in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the IFRC workforce will play a crucial role in passing real-time information about suspected outbreaks to WHO’s national mpox response team. This team includes polio experts who have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in previous disease eradication initiatives. “By combining WHO’s technical expertise and national coordination with IFRC’s grassroots community mobilization, we can create a powerful and complementary response mechanism. This partnership ensures interventions are scientifically sound and locally relevant, setting a new standard for integrated and effective outbreak responses,” said Dr Abdou Salam Gueye, WHO’s Regional Emergency Director for Africa. Epidemiological surveillance conducted in collaboration with IFRC will support the mpox vaccine rollout in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is set to begin in the coming weeks. WHO will be able to use data to guide vaccines to where they are needed most. WHO is supporting countries experiencing mpox outbreaks through multiple response strategies, including enhancing disease surveillance, vaccine introduction readiness, contact tracing, training and combating misinformation.

WHO delivers 33.5 metric tonnes of medical supplies to the Democratic Republic of th...,2024-09-20,"WHO delivers 33.5 metric tonnes of medical supplies to the Democratic Republic of the Congo 20 September 2024 Kinshasa – In its largest air cargo shipment to the African region this year, World Health Organization (WHO) today delivered 33.5 metric tonnes of emergency medical supplies and equipment to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to reinforce mpox outbreak response. Today’s delivery follows an initial shipment of more than 14 metric tonnes of emergency supplies to the country two weeks ago to support infection prevention and control, and clinical care measures in the ongoing outbreak. The two shipments will contribute significantly to infection prevention and treatment services in the country for the next three months. In addition to reinforcing the mpox outbreak response, the medical equipment and supplies will also be delivered to laboratories as well as district and referral health facilities to provide care for other medical conditions. “We’re intensifying our support to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in all critical areas of the mpox outbreak response, ensuring adequate testing, prevention and effective clinical care to stop the spread of this virus,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “We’re grateful to our partners for the important collaboration in strengthening the ongoing national efforts to bring this outbreak to an end.” The Democratic Republic of the Congo accounts for about 90% of the more than 31 000 suspected mpox cases reported so far this year from 14 countries in the African region. WHO is working closely with partners and the government to enhance capacity, expertise and outbreak response measures. The spread of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is attributed to two distinct main outbreaks: the spread of mpox clade Ia in the western Equateur and other provinces of the country where the disease is endemic, including spread to and outbreaks in the capital Kinshasa; and the spread of clade Ib in North and South Kivu provinces in the east, with a few cases in Kinshasa. As part of increased support to the mpox outbreak response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO is expanding its operational capacity in the field, with more than 300 disease surveillance and outbreak response experts from WHO’s polio response programme recently integrated into mpox outbreak control efforts. In collaboration with national health authorities and partners, WHO experts are also working closely with communities to raise awareness about mpox, promote preventive measures and encourage reporting of cases. Efforts are also being ramped up to strengthen national diagnostic capacities by providing testing kits, reagents and machines to decentralize testing in eight laboratories. On 19 September 2024, WHO dispatched 3500 GeneXpert cartridges to provincial laboratories to ensure adequate testing for effective clinical care, thanks to support from the United States Agency for International Development. In readiness for mpox vaccine rollout, WHO is working with countries to ramp up measures to ensure effective introduction of the vaccines. WHO has developed an mpox vaccine roadmap and readiness tool and is supporting countries to develop national vaccine deployment plans that target those populations at highest risk.

Three Central African countries commit to global eradication of Guinea-worm disease,2024-09-18,"Three Central African countries commit to global eradication of Guinea-worm disease 18 September 2024 N’Djamena – Ministers of Health of Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Chad have pledged to scale up efforts to eradicate Guinea-worm disease by 2030 in line with the road map to end neglected tropical diseases by the end of the decade. Meeting on 17 September 2024 at an international high-level meeting to advocate and mobilize resources for the eradication of Guinea-worm disease, the ministers signed the N'Djamena Declaration on interrupting the transmission of Guinea-worm disease or dracunculiasis in the subregion. The N'Djamena meeting was organized by the Government of Chad, in collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO) and The Carter Center. The meeting highlighted the need to scale up community-based surveillance, while maintaining and increasing domestic funding for national programmes to stop transmission. The discussions also identified the need to strengthen advocacy for access to drinking water and for implementing legal and regulatory measures to control dog and cat populations with a view to halting the spread of Guinea-worm disease and rabies within communities. The final point focused on strengthening synchronized cross-border interventions in endemic districts. “The holding of this international meeting in N’Djamena takes on special significance, as only five countries in the world are currently endemic to this disease, including our own,"" said H.E Allah-Maye Halina Mahamat, the Prime Minister of Chad. “As a signatory to the Abu Dhabi Declaration in March 2022 in the United Arab Emirates, Chad is committed to strengthening its leadership with a view to improving the health and well-being of its people. That commitment has been given tangible expression. In line with its steadfast commitment, Chad will continue to strengthen its strategies and actions to combat Guinea-worm disease.” Chad accounts for over 50% of human cases of infection with Guinea-worm disease, and over 80% of animal infections recorded worldwide each year. The global incidence of the disease has dropped steeply, from around 3.5 million cases in the 1980s to just 14 in 2023, including nine in Chad. The human cases reported by Cameroon and the Central African Republic in 2019 and 2022 respectively are strongly suspected of having been imported from Chad, given the population movements on both sides of the border. “Just as the people of Chad no longer face the threat of African trypanosomiasis, so today we stand on the threshold of freeing Chad – and the world – from Guinea-worm disease,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This achievement is not just about numbers; it is about lives transformed and communities empowered.” Significant progress has been made to eradicate Guinea worm in the African region with over 99 % reduction in cases from 843 640 when the eradication campaign was launched in 1989, to just 14 cases in 2023. Forty-two countries have been certified as having eradicated the disease; five remain to be certified (Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan). The last mile to eradication faces huge challenges such as animal transmission creating spill-over infections to humans, inadequate safe water supply, dwindling funding, insecurity, cross border population movements, and climate change impacting water river basins. “I encourage Governments to prioritize Guinea-worm disease surveillance across borders, integrate its eradication interventions into other disease control interventions and expand financing network through domestic resource mobilization,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, congratulating Chad on its progress towards the elimination of neglected tropical diseases, notably the elimination of human African trypanosomiasis as a public health problem by 2024. WHO recommends maintaining active dracunculiasis surveillance for at least 3 consecutive years in countries and/or areas that have recently interrupted transmission. Such surveillance is essential to ensure that no human or animal cases of the disease go undetected, and to prevent any recurrence. The Organization advocates for eradication, provides technical guidance, coordinates eradication activities, ensures the implementation of surveillance in dracunculiasis-free areas, monitors the situation and tracks progress.

The human cases reported by Cameroon and the Central African Republic in 2019 and 2022 respectively are strongly suspected of having been imported from Chad, given the population movements on both sides of the border. “Just as the people of Chad no longer face the threat of African trypanosomiasis, so today we stand on the threshold of freeing Chad – and the world – from Guinea-worm disease,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This achievement is not just about numbers; it is about lives transformed and communities empowered.” Significant progress has been made to eradicate Guinea worm in the African region with over 99 % reduction in cases from 843 640 when the eradication campaign was launched in 1989, to just 14 cases in 2023. Forty-two countries have been certified as having eradicated the disease; five remain to be certified (Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan). The last mile to eradication faces huge challenges such as animal transmission creating spill-over infections to humans, inadequate safe water supply, dwindling funding, insecurity, cross border population movements, and climate change impacting water river basins. “I encourage Governments to prioritize Guinea-worm disease surveillance across borders, integrate its eradication interventions into other disease control interventions and expand financing network through domestic resource mobilization,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, congratulating Chad on its progress towards the elimination of neglected tropical diseases, notably the elimination of human African trypanosomiasis as a public health problem by 2024. WHO recommends maintaining active dracunculiasis surveillance for at least 3 consecutive years in countries and/or areas that have recently interrupted transmission. Such surveillance is essential to ensure that no human or animal cases of the disease go undetected, and to prevent any recurrence. The Organization advocates for eradication, provides technical guidance, coordinates eradication activities, ensures the implementation of surveillance in dracunculiasis-free areas, monitors the situation and tracks progress.

"Sahel, Lake Chad Basin countries coordinate joint polio eradication plan",2024-09-16,"Sahel, Lake Chad Basin countries coordinate joint polio eradication plan 16 September 2024 Brazzaville/Dakar — In a significant move to combat the ongoing challenge of variant poliovirus transmission in Central and West Africa, Ministers of Health from the Lake Chad Basin countries and Sahel sub-region have published this week a comprehensive cross-border coordination plan for 2024/2025. This critical initiative aims to bolster joint efforts to eradicate polio and prevent its spread across national borders, ensuring a safer and healthier future for millions of children. The Lake Chad Basin and Sahel regions present unique challenges in the fight against polio, as they remain critical engines of transmission in Africa. Despite significant efforts, variant poliovirus type 2 continues to spread across these areas, driven by factors such as insecurity, inadequate healthcare access, and high population mobility. This cross-border coordination plan aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven key countries—Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Niger and Nigeria—to interrupt transmission by the end of 2025. The African Region, declared free of indigenous wild poliovirus in August 2020, now faces a new and urgent threat: the intense transmission of type 2 variant poliovirus. The initiative is part of a broader Africa Regional Polio Eradication Action Plan that sets a bold and comprehensive approach to end all forms of poliovirus transmission in Africa. The plan emphasizes a more aggressive outbreak response strategy, treating all polio cases, including those linked to circulating variant polioviruses, with the same urgency as wild poliovirus. With the implementation of expanded, high-quality immunization campaigns, the plan aims to interrupt all ongoing polio transmission by December 2025. Central to this strategy will be the new ¨Lake Chad Basin Task Team¨, a coordination office based in N'djamena to centralize the polio response. This will help health authorities, technical teams, and countries to better coordinate by sharing information in real time for informed public health decisions. “This situation demands a unified, inter-country response akin to the successful efforts that eliminated the wild poliovirus, therefore we are working on a robust incident management system to ensure synchronized vaccinations and cross-border coordination” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. High-level political commitment is central to the success of this initiative. During the virtual interministerial meeting on 16 August 2024 and during a Side Event attended by Member States from the African region, senior government leaders and Global Polio Eradication Initiative partners expressed commitment to interrupt variant poliovirus transmission. In 2024 alone, 134 polio detections (both in the environment and in affected people, as of September 5th) have been reported jointly in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Niger and Nigeria. In response, nearly 70 million children have been vaccinated across these critical areas since the beginning of the year. Recognizing the critical need for renewed collaboration, government leaders, along with WHO, UNICEF and other partners came together in July and August 2024 and crafted a new plan focused on eradicating the variant poliovirus across seven key countries. These discussions culminated in the endorsement of the new plan, which outlines ten key commitments to eradicate the variant poliovirus across the seven countries. “We commend the governments for their leadership in implementing high-quality synchronized polio campaigns involving all key stakeholders, especially communities and traditional leaders. Together, we can make a difference”, said Gilles Fagninou, UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa. The plan starts by emphasizing the critical importance of making the interruption of transmission a top health priority. This goal is to be achieved by advocating for sustained political commitment at the highest levels of government and establishing dedicated Incident Management Systems in each country. To ensure effective collaboration across the region, the plan supports the establishment of multi-country coordination mechanisms. These mechanisms will oversee cross-border activities, facilitating seamless cooperation among nations. Central to the strategy is the development and implementation of national plans that prioritize cross-border coordination. A key element of these plans is also the synchronization of polio vaccination campaigns across borders, which will enable the coverage of all at-risk populations, particularly those living in border regions. To bolster these efforts, the plan aims to enhance cross-border activities that focus on reporting, detection, information-sharing, and response coordination. Special attention will be given to mobile populations and hard-to-reach areas, ensuring no one is left behind. Strengthening routine immunization efforts is also a priority, with a particular focus on reaching unvaccinated and under-vaccinated children. Joint community engagement activities across borders will be conducted to foster cooperation and ensure communities are well-informed and involved in the eradication efforts. Regular vaccination and disease surveillance data sharing among all partners and neighbouring countries will be enabled using specialized tools, such as Geographic Information System technology. This will facilitate timely and accurate decision-making. Lastly, a robust monitoring and accountability framework will be established, with regular ministerial dialogues to evaluate progress and address challenges, ensuring the sustained momentum needed to achieve the goal of eradicating variant poliovirus in the region. With the goal of ending active poliovirus outbreaks in the Region by the end of 2025, this collective effort is vital to achieving a polio-free Africa by the end of 2026. The endorsement of this plan marks a renewed commitment to safeguard current and future generations from the life-long effects of polio.

African CDC and WHO launch joint continental plan to scale up mpox outbreak response,2024-09-06,"African CDC and WHO launch joint continental plan to scale up mpox outbreak response 06 September 2024 KINSHASA – In a significant step to strengthen and accelerate the response to the ongoing the mpox outbreak, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) today launched a joint continental response plan for Africa to support countries’ efforts to curb the spread of the virus, save and protect lives. The launch of the Mpox Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan follows the declarations of a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) on 13 August 2024 by Africa CDC, and a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 14 August 2024 by WHO. “We are proud to jointly launch this plan which unites all stakeholders in a coordinated approach to tackling the mpox outbreaks across Africa,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director General. “This unified strategy ensures that all partners are aligned on common objectives, eliminating duplication and maximizing impact.” The overall estimated budget for the six-month plan, running from September 2024 to February 2025, is close to US$ 600 million with 55% allocated to mpox response in 14 affected Member States and readiness in 15 other Member States, while 45% is directed towards operational and technical support through partners. “This is an important milestone for a coordinated action between our agencies to support countries by reinforcing expertise, mobilizing resources and capacities to swiftly and effectively halt the spread of mpox,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa “By coming together we can achieve more, and our collective strength will carry us further, ensuring that communities and individuals are protected from the threat of this virus.” Over the past three years, mpox cases have increased at an unprecedented rate in Africa. In addition to zoonosis-linked outbreaks, the intensified human-to-human transmission through sexual behaviours and other factors, requires urgent attention and an enhanced response. To address the ongoing mpox outbreaks, a comprehensive strategy is critical for effective management and mitigation. The Mpox Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan emphasizes a community-centred, multisectoral approach tailored to the unique epidemiology and risk profiles of each Member state. The plan bolsters surveillance, laboratory testing, community engagement, and ensures the availability of critical countermeasures, while building resilient and equitable health systems. Under the plan, Member States are classified into four categories based on their Mpox status and risk level: Countries with sustained human-to-human transmission Countries with sporadic human cases since January 2022 or endemic zoonotic reservoirs Countries needing enhanced readiness due to proximity to countries with ongoing transmission. All other countries not part of the three categories. Priority actions are outlined for each category to guide national strategies in responding to the mpox epidemic. The plan includes measures to strengthen surveillance, laboratory detection, case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), vaccination, risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) and research and innovation. This continental response, co-coordinated by Africa CDC and WHO, is supported by workstreams led by key partners, leveraging their comparative advantages. WHO and Africa CDC will collaborate with stakeholders, including UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, and civil society, which will participate in relevant pillars of the response. In line with the Lusaka Agenda, the Mpox response will follow the “one team, one plan, one budge, one M&E” approach. To that end, a continental Incident Management Team has been established, comprising members from key partners.

"African health ministers, partners urge equitable access to critical tools to curb c...",2024-08-29,"WHO / Blink Media - Etinosa Yvonne Credits African health ministers, partners urge equitable access to critical tools to curb cervical cancer threat 29 August 2024 Brazzaville – Inequitable access to vaccines and high-performance screening tools is hampering efforts to effectively reduce the growing burden of cervical cancer in the African region, which accounts for the highest rates of new cases and deaths due to the disease. Despite being preventable and treatable through human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and screening, and curable when detected early, cervical cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the African region. Of the more than 76 000 cervical cancer deaths globally in 2022, the most updated data available, nearly a quarter (23%) were in Africa. At a special event during the Seventy-fourth session of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee for Africa, being hosted by the Republic of the Congo in Brazzaville this week, African health ministers and partners highlighted the urgent need for equitable access to affordable HPV vaccines and HPV DNA testing, to accelerate progress towards elimination. To date, only 28 countries in the African region have introduced HPV vaccines into routine immunization programmes, with just four of these achieving 90% vaccination coverage in 2023. For screening, surveys reveal very low coverage of about 11%. Only 17 countries have introduced HPV-based screening, albeit not nationally, highlighting the importance of an integrated person-centred approach. “Cervical cancer services need to be integrated throughout the life course to leverage the opportunities of other programs within the health system”. I urge all to collectively work together in awareness creation for the fight against cervical cancer”, noted, Mr Gilbert Mokoki, Minister of Health of Congo, speaking on behalf of the First lady of Congo, H.E Antoinette Sassou N’Guesso. According to modelling by HPV-ADVISE, involving 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, current vaccination coverage and screening uptake rates are inadequate to enable elimination of cervical cancer by 2100. However, if countries achieve and maintain the WHO-recommended 90% vaccination coverage for girls, and 70% screening uptake targets, the modelling shows that 24 million cervical cancers would be averted by the turn of the century. “The burden of cervical cancer in Africa is a stark illustration of the impacts of global inequities, which exacerbate barriers including scarce resources, lack of prioritization by funders, and ultimately, limited capacity to manage the threat. Affordable and accessible HPV tests and vaccines are critical if we are to accelerate elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem in the region, and narrow the wide gap in health inequality globally,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa. The special event at the Regional Committee aimed to spark high-level political advocacy and partner buy-in, specifically the initiation of a joint regional mechanism to increase access to HPV vaccines and HPV-based tests, so boosting cervical cancer screening and prevention coverage. A critical element for success, WHO stressed is the delivery of cervical cancer services within a people-centred, primary health care approach, to ensure accessibility and sustainability. In Cameroon, Malawi, Uganda and Zimbabwe, for example, cervical cancer screening has been integrated into HIV and sexual and reproductive health services. The proven cost-effectiveness of these interventions supports the argument for broader implementation, with all eligible women who visit health facilities, at any level, being offered comprehensive cervical cancer services. “As partners, we need to take advantage of the overlap between cervical cancer and other services for women, such as HIV programs and reproductive health services, to ensure integration at policy, financing, programme and service level,” said Dr Phillipe Duneton, Executive Director of Unitaid.

First-ever delivery of mpox vaccines in Africa outside of clinical trials arrives in...,2024-08-27,"First-ever delivery of mpox vaccines in Africa outside of clinical trials arrives in Nigeria 27 August 2024 Abuja/Brazzaville – Nigeria today received 10 000 doses of mpox vaccines, becoming the first country in the African region to receive doses to respond to the outbreak of the viral disease that has affected several countries and led to the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern by World Health Organization (WHO). The vaccine, Jynneos (MVA), manufactured by Bavarian Nordic pharmaceutical firm, were donated by the United States government. The vaccines are set to be rolled out in five states with the highest burden of mpox cases. They will be administered in a two-dose schedule to 5 000 people most at risk of mpox, including close contacts of mpox cases and frontline healthcare workers, with a provision for reactive vaccination in other states as the need arises. “We are pleased to receive this modest initial donation of the mpox vaccine which is safe and efficacious. We will continue to strengthen surveillance and be vigilant to prevent and control mpox. We urge the global health community to expand access to vaccines,” said Hon Muhammad Ali Pate, Nigeria’s Minister of Health. In preparation for vaccine administration, Nigeria’s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has granted Emergency Use Authorization for the mpox vaccine. The health authorities have also taken measures to preposition the vaccines to reach priority populations. “The delivery of the mpox vaccines to Nigeria not only constitutes a crucial addition to the ongoing measures to halt the virus and protect health, it’s also a clear demonstration of international solidarity in the face of global public health emergencies,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director of Africa. “We are grateful for the generosity of the United States government and look forward to increased global support to effectively address the threat of mpox.” There are currently serious gaps in mpox vaccine access, especially in Africa. WHO is working with countries and manufacturers to ramp up access to vaccines. WHO Director-General has triggered the process for Emergency Use Listing of vaccines to accelerate vaccine access, particularly for lower-income countries. WHO is also working with partners like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and UNICEF to enable donations from countries with existing stockpiles. The partners are building a donation scheme so that the limited vaccines are used where they have the greatest public health impact. Nigeria is scaling up key aspects of outbreak response areas. WHO is supporting the government to strengthen surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory capacity, risk communication and community engagement. The health authorities are also carrying out early case detection and diagnostics, and enhancing cross-border surveillance, including at major points of entry across the country. The country has reported mpox cases for several years, with a peak in 2022. As of 10 August 2024, there were 786 suspected cases, 39 confirmed cases, with no deaths so far this year. So far this year, 12 countries in the African region are reporting cases. In total more than 15 000 suspected cases have been reported since the beginning of this year. Out of these, over 3500 cases are laboratory-confirmed, including 26 deaths. WHO is working with national authorities and partners to strengthen response measures in the affected countries and step up preparedness in countries yet to report cases.

First-ever delivery of mpox vaccines in Africa outside of clinical trials arrives in...,2024-08-27,"First-ever delivery of mpox vaccines in Africa outside of clinical trials arrives in Nigeria 27 August 2024 Abuja/Brazzaville – Nigeria today received 10 000 doses of mpox vaccines, becoming the first country in the African region to receive doses to respond to the outbreak of the viral disease that has affected several countries and led to the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern by World Health Organization (WHO). The vaccine, Jynneos (MVA), manufactured by Bavarian Nordic pharmaceutical firm, were donated by the United States government. The vaccines are set to be rolled out in five states with the highest burden of mpox cases. They will be administered in a two-dose schedule to 5 000 people most at risk of mpox, including close contacts of mpox cases and frontline healthcare workers, with a provision for reactive vaccination in other states as the need arises. “We are pleased to receive this modest initial donation of the mpox vaccine which is safe and efficacious. We will continue to strengthen surveillance and be vigilant to prevent and control mpox. We urge the global health community to expand access to vaccines,” said Hon Muhammad Ali Pate, Nigeria’s Minister of Health. In preparation for vaccine administration, Nigeria’s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has granted Emergency Use Authorization for the mpox vaccine. The health authorities have also taken measures to preposition the vaccines to reach priority populations. “The delivery of the mpox vaccines to Nigeria not only constitutes a crucial addition to the ongoing measures to halt the virus and protect health, it’s also a clear demonstration of international solidarity in the face of global public health emergencies,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director of Africa. “We are grateful for the generosity of the United States government and look forward to increased global support to effectively address the threat of mpox.” There are currently serious gaps in mpox vaccine access, especially in Africa.

The commitments were made during the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee for Africa, with Member States underscoring the importance of investing in global health and ensuring a strong WHO. “I thank our African Region Member States for actively supporting WHO’s first Investment Round to mobilize predictable and flexible resources needed for our core work over the next four years,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Full, sustainable funding will enable WHO to support countries better in their work to build healthier, more resilient, and more prosperous populations.” The countries and partners came together for the historic event aimed at sustainably funding WHO and thus enabling it to more effectively fulfil its mandate and advance key objectives to promote, provide and protect health and well-being for all. The countries included Botswana, Cabo Verde, Chad, Congo, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania and The Gambia. Many partners joined Members States in making commitments of support to WHO and committing to providing pledges later in the year, including Helmsley Charitable Trust, World Diabetes Foundation, Roche, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, African Development Bank and the WHO Foundation. “A strong, predictable and sustainably financed WHO is essential for our region and the world to meet the multiple health threats we face; and support the prevention of disease based on the vast evidence at our disposal,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Every pledge and every partnership counts.

African health ministers kick off region’s top health forum,2024-08-26,"WHO/Elombat Daniel Credits African health ministers kick off region’s top health forum 26 August 2024 Brazzaville – African health ministers and government representatives gathering in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, today kicked off the Seventy-fourth session of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee for Africa, the continent’s flagship health forum held annually to discuss and agree on measures to address health challenges and promote people’s well-being. The meeting, which takes place from 26–30 August 2024 in Congo’s capital city, brings together health ministers from the 47 countries of the WHO African Region to discuss and approve regional policies, and adopt key resolutions to guide the Organization’s work on the continent. During this year’s meeting, the ministers will also nominate a new Regional Director to succeed Dr Matshidiso Moeti, who is ending her 10-year tenure at the helm. “The Republic of the Congo is honoured to host this important session of the World Health Organization's Regional Committee for Africa,” said H. E President Denis Sassou N’Guesso at the opening of the Regional Committee, pointing out that “health is our greatest asset ... WHO's commitment to this noble cause to ensure people’s survival is a great encouragement …” “This meeting is being held at a decisive moment for Africa. The continent is facing unprecedented challenges that require immediate and concerted action on our part,” said Ambassador Minata Samaté Cessouma, African Union Commissioner for Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development. Key agenda items include a focus on mitigating high rates of child mortality and the need to urgently turn the tide on this significant threat to Africa’s children. Polio and cervical cancer are two other health challenges that will receive special attention. For polio, the aim is to reinforce commitments and strategize to achieve complete eradication; for cervical cancer, a special side event will highlight the need to prioritize prevention through human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and screening. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Member States for strengthening emergency preparedness and primary health care, negotiating a pandemic agreement and supporting the Investment Round to increase sustainable financing for WHO. But the new mpox outbreaks showed why sustained commitment and investment was needed to protect and promote public health in Africa, Dr Tedros added. “WHO is committed to working with African countries and partners to bring the mpox outbreaks under control quickly, and I am confident we can,” Dr Tedros said. “But the emergency highlights the weaknesses in the health security architecture, in Africa and globally. This is why all Member States should actively engage in negotiations on the Pandemic Agreement and invest in WHO and public health, to protect people today and tomorrow.” This week’s events will also provide a platform to recognize the significant progress made in the WHO African region, specifically the celebrated Transformation Agenda, driven by Dr Moeti during her mandate as Regional Director. The region has also been declared free of wild poliovirus, marking a historic public health victory, while 19 African countries have successfully eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease. “Never before have governments and partners been so determined to make a better impact - through supporting integrated approaches to addressing health problems; focusing on people; and reducing the fragmentation that has limited the outcomes of significant health investments,” said Dr Moeti. About 800 participants are attending the event, including representatives from United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations, civil society, academia and development partners, either in-person or virtually.

Scaling up response to curb growing mpox outbreak in African region,2024-08-15,"WHO / Katson Maliro Credits Scaling up response to curb growing mpox outbreak in African region 15 August 2024 Brazzaville – As the mpox outbreak that has affected the Democratic Republic of the Congo and spread to neighbouring countries continues to grow, World Health Organization (WHO) is intensifying support to countries to scale up measures to curb the virus and save lives. On the advice of independent experts of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, WHO Director-General has determined that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The emergence of a new strain of the mpox virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its rapid spread, including to neighbouring countries, is one of the main reasons for the declaration of the PHEIC, the second such determination in two years relating to the disease. So far this year, more than 2100 laboratory-confirmed cases and 13 deaths have been reported from 12 countries (Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda) compared with 1145 confirmed cases and seven deaths in the whole of 2023 reported from 11 countries. “We are hard at work on the frontlines of the response, collaborating closely with governments and communities to strengthen mpox control measures and are ramping up efforts to curb the widening trend of the virus through coordinated action with partners and national authorities,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. WHO is stepping up support to the affected countries by deploying additional experts, including epidemiologists and anthropologists, and providing initial funding to accelerate outbreak response measures. Efforts are underway to enhance cross-border collaboration for case investigation, contact tracing and community engagement to ensure compliance with preventive measures. The Organization is also supporting national regulatory authorities to speed up regulatory approvals, as well as providing guidance to national immunization technical advisory groups to ensure readiness for vaccine rollout. WHO has triggered the process for Emergency Use Listing for mpox vaccines, which will accelerate vaccine access for lower-income countries which have not yet issued their own national regulatory approval. Emergency Use Listing enables partners including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and UNICEF to procure vaccines for distribution. Efforts are also being ramped up to strengthen national diagnostic capacities by providing testing kits, reagents and machines to decentralize testing. Genomic sequencing is also ongoing to determine the mpox clades. To enhance preparedness in countries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo and those at risk, disease surveillance and training of frontline health workers are being stepped up as well as public awareness campaigns. Caused by an Orthopoxvirus, mpox was first detected in humans in 1970, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The disease is considered endemic to countries in central and west Africa. Mpox is transmitted from animals to humans. It can also spread from humans to humans through contact with bodily fluids, lesions on the skin or on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth or throat, respiratory droplets and contaminated objects.

Kenya: Strengthening the health workforce ,2024-08-13,"Kenya: Strengthening the health workforce 13 August 2024 Nairobi – Five years ago, Esther Omagwa was one of only two nurses at the Railways Health Centre in Kisumu County, western Kenya. The immense workload often exhausted her, forcing her to turn away clients. Today, the scene at the community health centre is remarkably different. With the nursing staff now expanded to a team of four, Omagwa and her colleagues are better equipped to deal with the load. “These days I can respond to patients efficiently. Even when one of us goes on leave, we still have capacity.” Esther Omagwa, nurse The health centre’s overall staff has tripled to 30 and this includes specialists for services such as maternal and child health, cardiology, orthopaedics and mental health. “Since we have been able to incorporate more specialized services in each department, we haven’t had to refer as many patients to larger facilities,” says Violet Ouma, a laboratory officer at the health centre. Kisumu is one of Kenya’s six model counties for human resources for health, having successfully piloted the primary health care networks initiative in Kenya and reflects a broader transformation that is taking place in the country’s health service delivery. According to Kenya’s 2023 Health Labour Market Analysis, the country has doubled its health workforce in the last 10 years to almost 190 000 active health workers across 13 major health occupations, including nurses, midwives, doctors, surgeons and other specialists. Currently, the country produces approximately 8200 health care workers annually and by 2031, the number of health workers is projected to climb to over 270 000. Efforts to increase digitalization at facility level is producing timely and accurate data collection, which helps health authorities identify staffing needs and gaps, facilitate targeted training programmes and distribute medical professionals equitably across the country. “In the past we’ve been using the manual way of collecting data and currently all our services are being digitalized,” says Flavia Naudi, Health Records Information Officer at Railways Health Centre. “We are part of the new generation that is actually using technology to improve healthcare service delivery on staffing and specialization.” In 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) introduced Kenya’s Ministry of Health to the National Health Workforce Accounts, a system designed by the Organization to help countries collect, analyse and use data related to their health workforce. So far, the country has conducted three cycles, helping to better identify staffing needs and investment areas and aligning with the Kenya Human Resources for Health Strategy 2019–2023. The implementation of National Health Workforce Accounts provided a foundation for a Health Labour Market Analysis, conducted between 2021 and 2023 and supported by WHO. The analysis provided evidence for the mismatch between supply and demand of health workers and the feasibility and impact of different policy options. “Health workers are the backbone of the health system. The steps that the country is taking to improve the quality and quantity of the health workforce will help universal health coverage become a reality,” says Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO Representative to Kenya. Data shows that despite significant improvements, as of 2020, the density of health workers was 13.8 per 10 000 people, highlighting a significant gap in health care provision. For Kenya to meet population health needs and achieve universal health coverage by 2030, an estimated 7‒11% increase of current investment is required. According to Professor Francis Wafula, the board chair of the Kenya Health Human Resource Advisory Council a critical issue is inequitable distribution of health care workers, not only across Kenya’s 47 counties but also between urban and rural areas, even in the six model counties. “We have a problem of poor distribution of health work force across the country. We need to strike a balance between what is acceptable in the context that we have and what inefficient use of the health workforce,” he says. “Compared to the time when I was young, the nurses were few. But now, at least the numbers have improved.” Violet Odongo, health client Despite these challenges, Kenya has several opportunities to further strengthen its health workforce.

African region faces an unprecedent surge in mpox cases,2024-08-08,"WHO / Eugene Kabambi Credits African region faces an unprecedent surge in mpox cases 08 August 2024 Brazzaville – The African region is experiencing an unprecedented increase in mpox cases since the start of 2024, with more countries previously unaffected by the disease reporting cases in an expanding spread of the virus. World Health Organization (WHO) has elevated the mpox outbreak response to the highest-level requiring organization-wide mobilization and scale-up. In addition, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called for an emergency committee of experts meeting to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Fifteen African countries are currently reporting mpox outbreak, with a total of 2030 confirmed cases and 13 deaths so far this year compared with 1145 cases and seven deaths in the whole of 2023. Four countries – Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda – previously unaffected by mpox have reported cases since mid-July 2024. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which accounts for more than 90% of the reported cases, a new variant that emerged in September 2023 is circulating in its eastern region. Neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda have reported cases of the new variant. Kenya has also confirmed cases of the new variant. Analysis are ongoing in Burundi to determine whether the reported cases are due to the new variant. “The priority is to rapidly interrupt the transmission of the virus. We’re collaborating with partners in support of countries to reinforce outbreak control measures and ensure that communities are central to ongoing efforts to effectively end these outbreaks,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. The pattern of transmission varies across the region, with the spread of new variant (known as clade 1b) in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo linked to transmission through sexual contact and high population movement, while in South Africa most of the cases are among people identifying as men having sex with men. Transmission in West and Central Africa is associated with the 2022 global outbreak. However, further analysis is required to better understand the patterns of transmission to refine the response to the outbreak. WHO is working at the global, regional and national levels as well as with partners, including the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and others to ensure effective response to the outbreak. In the African region, WHO is working through country teams and experts deployed on the ground to support national authorities strengthen key response areas, including disease surveillance, diagnosis testing and clinical care, infection prevention and control. WHO is working with the health authorities to access therapeutics, decentralize laboratory services for enhanced diagnostic capacities, and ramp up efforts to raise awareness about the risk of the disease among communities. Field investigation and active case finding are also being reinforced in the affected and at-risk countries. The Organization is coordinating closely to enhance contact tracing, leveraging experience from prior outbreaks to ensure interventions best support and elevate the needs of key populations. WHO is also mobilizing financial support to help countries effectively respond to the outbreak. WHO is advancing the process for Emergency Use Listing Procedure, an approach to assess and list unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to expediting their availability for use during public health emergencies. The Organization is already working closely with countries to develop their vaccination strategies and plans, to roll out the vaccines as soon as they are available. Vaccines are one among many public health tools that are used to control mpox. Mpox is transmitted from animals to humans, with cases often found close to tropical rainforests where there are animals that carry the virus. The disease can also spread from humans to humans through contact with bodily fluids, lesions on the skin or on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth or throat, respiratory droplets and contaminated objects. Treatment of mpox patients is supportive dependent on the symptoms. Various therapeutics that may be effective against mpox are being developed and tested. Prevention and control of rely on raising awareness in communities and educating health workers to prevent infection and stop transmission.

Building public health resilience in Sierra Leone: training 72 SURGE workforce for r...,2024-08-05,"Building public health resilience in Sierra Leone: training 72 SURGE workforce for rapid public health emergency response 05 August 2024 Sierra Leone achieved a significant milestone in strengthening t public health emergency response capabilities by training and certifying 72 public health rapid emergency responders, ready for deployment within 24-48 hours within and outside the country. This training is a key component of the World Health Organization's (WHO) broader strategy to build resilient health systems across Africa, reducing the strain on national health systems and preventing severe socio-economic disruptions associated with public health emergencies.Public health threats such as disease outbreaks, disasters and humanitarian emergencies are a persistent challenge across Africa, with over 100 events annually. Sierra Leone, in particular, suffered severely during the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak and later the COVID-19 pandemic, which overwhelmed its health systems and caused widespread socio-economic damage. Ebola exposed significant gaps in the country's public health infrastructure, overwhelming the system and causing thousands of deaths including frontline healthcare workers. The COVID-19 pandemic further underscored the need for ongoing training and a multidisciplinary response team to manage future threats effectively.The Ministry of Health Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Sartie Kenneh, reflecting on past experiences in responding to health emergencies, stated, ""the journey we've undertaken is just beginning, but with the dedication of our team, I am confident we will succeed. Your commitment to serving humanity, even in the face of immense challenges, is commendable.""In response to the regional health emergencies challenges, WHO launched three flagship initiatives to build capacity and improve preparedness across the continent. These initiatives include the Promoting Resilience of Systems for Emergencies (PROSE) focusing on preparedness, Transforming African Surveillance Systems (TASS) focusing on detection, and the - Strengthening and Utilizing Response Groups for Emergencies (SURGE) focusing on response. WHO played a crucial role, working with MOH and other partners, in developing and validating the national roadmap for this initiative in Sierra Leone, ensuring alignment with global best practices and the specific needs of the country.The successful implementation of the AVoHC-SURGE initiative in Sierra Leone was made possible through financial support from Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and strong collaboration between WHO, Africa CDC, US CDC, and USAID. These partners provided essential guidance, resources, and technical support, enabling Sierra Leone to rapidly identify and train suitable candidates for the program.Dr. Robert Musoke the WHO Country Office Health Emergencies and Preparedness (EPR) Cluster Lead while representing the WHO Representative, Dr Innocent Nuwagira, proudly noted, ""Over the past six weeks, we've made remarkable progress, with seventy-two dedicated individuals now ready to be deployed at a moment's notice, both within our country and beyond. As we move forward, we will continue to maintain our readiness and knowledge, ensuring that when the call comes, we are prepared to act swiftly and efficiently.""The selection process identified 98 participants from diverse backgrounds, and from multiple sectors of government. These individuals underwent one-month intensive training over two phases: from June 17th to July 2nd, 2024, and from July 21st to August 3rd, 2024. The training emphasized a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together participants from various ministries, departments, and agencies to work as a cohesive team.In addition to disease outbreaks, the training prepared participants to handle other public health crises, such as humanitarian disasters and climate-related emergencies, which are common across the continent. Critical issues like gender-based violence, psychological preparedness, and stress management were also addressed to ensure responders are equipped to manage both the human and technical aspects of crises.Professor Adebola Olayinka, the WHO AFRO AVoHC-SURGE Coordinator and Lead Facilitator, highlighted the importance of these efforts: ""Through dedication and collaboration, we’ve transformed our capacity to respond to public health emergencies. The AVoHC SURGE Training not only equipped these responders with vital skills but also built a network of resilience and readiness.""The training concluded with practical drills where participants, organized into groups of six, demonstrated their skills and competences. A graduation ceremony followed, certifying the 72 successful trainees, with key stakeholders from various ministries and agencies, including Agriculture, Environment and Climate Change, Health, Defense, National Disaster Management Agency, National Fire Force, and collaborating partners such as Africa CDC, US CDC, and USAID in attendance. Among the beneficiaries, Dr. Sarah Kadijatu Conteh, Medical Superintendent of the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Hospital, expressed her gratitude, saying, ""The training has significantly enhanced my knowledge in working within a multidisciplinary team and boosted my confidence in handling outbreaks. I am deeply thankful for this opportunity and extend my sincere appreciation to the government, WHO and US CDC for their invaluable support.""With the support of WHO and other partners, Sierra Leone has made remarkable strides in strengthening its public health emergency response capabilities. The training and certification of 72 SURGE personnel is a critical step towards ensuring the country’s resilience and readiness to respond public health threats in the future. As Dr. Kenneh affirmed, ""We now have the critical mass to respond effectively, ensuring our country remains resilient and capable."" This progress contributes to a stronger, more resilient Africa, better prepared to safeguard public health across the continent.

"Mozambique introduces R21 vaccine, bolstering malaria control efforts ",2024-08-05,"Mozambique introduces R21 vaccine, bolstering malaria control efforts 05 August 2024 Maputo – Mozambique today reached an important milestone in malaria prevention among children with the introduction of the R21 vaccine, which will help reduce malaria cases and save thousands of children’s lives each year. In Africa, one child dies from malaria every minute. Through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and co-financing from the Government of Mozambique, the country has received about 800 000 malaria vaccine doses to vaccinate around 300 000 children through the country’s Expanded Programme on Immunization. The vaccine will be distributed in 22 districts in Zambézia province. It will be administered in a 4-dose schedule, with the first dose covering children aged 6 to 11 months. “The malaria vaccine, which is being rolled out initially in Zambezia today, is one of the latest approaches in the fight against the disease,” said Hon Dr Armindo Tiago, Minister of Health. “The choice of Zambezia as the launch site is due to the high burden of the disease in the province. The vaccine will be administered in four doses with the aim of reducing the severe malaria illness and death.” The WHO-recommended R21 vaccine is safe and effective. When provided in childhood immunization (programme?), it reduces over half of malaria cases (as high as 66%) in children during the first year of follow-up and prolonged protection with the fourth dose of vaccine. This vaccine represents an advancement for child health, disease control and reduction of child mortality. In Mozambique, malaria endemic, with a prevalence of 32% in under 5 children. “The introduction of the malaria vaccine into Mozambique's childhood vaccination programme is a historic event because it is the result of research and trials carried out by Mozambican scientists in Mozambique that led to the development of the first vaccine of its kind, the RTS,S vaccine. This pioneering work laid the foundations for WHO to recommend the RTS,S and R21 vaccines for childhood immunization from 2021,” Dr Severin von Xylander, WHO Representative in Mozambique The introduction of the malaria vaccine in Mozambique brings to 11 the number of countries on the African continent to offer malaria vaccines, with eight countries providing RTS,S and three offering R21 as part of childhood immunization programme. The wider malaria vaccine rollout is expanding access to more comprehensive prevention against the disease. Malaria continues to be a huge health challenge in the African region, which is home to 11 countries that bear approximately 70% of the global malaria burden. The region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of all malaria deaths in 2022, according to the 2023 World Malaria Report. In additional to the vaccine, efforts must continue to increase the coverage and use of insecticide-treated nets. Only 57% of households in Mozambique have at least one insecticide-treated net. Gavi, UNICEF, WHO and other partners are supporting the Ministry of Health in the preparation, acceptance and introduction of the malaria vaccine. The support ranges from developing vaccine implementation plans, communication strategies, conducting health professional training and community engagement, and ensuring sufficient cold chain capacity.

This pioneering work laid the foundations for WHO to recommend the RTS,S and R21 vaccines for childhood immunization from 2021,” Dr Severin von Xylander, WHO Representative in Mozambique The introduction of the malaria vaccine in Mozambique brings to 11 the number of countries on the African continent to offer malaria vaccines, with eight countries providing RTS,S and three offering R21 as part of childhood immunization programme. The wider malaria vaccine rollout is expanding access to more comprehensive prevention against the disease. Malaria continues to be a huge health challenge in the African region, which is home to 11 countries that bear approximately 70% of the global malaria burden. The region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of all malaria deaths in 2022, according to the 2023 World Malaria Report. In additional to the vaccine, efforts must continue to increase the coverage and use of insecticide-treated nets. Only 57% of households in Mozambique have at least one insecticide-treated net. Gavi, UNICEF, WHO and other partners are supporting the Ministry of Health in the preparation, acceptance and introduction of the malaria vaccine. The support ranges from developing vaccine implementation plans, communication strategies, conducting health professional training and community engagement, and ensuring sufficient cold chain capacity.

Forging Resilience: WHO AFRO Establishes Independent Expert Body to Bolster Africa's...,2024-07-17,"Forging Resilience: WHO AFRO Establishes Independent Expert Body to Bolster Africa's Health Security 17 July 2024 Emergency Preparedness and Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG) Brazzaville - In a major step towards strengthening health security in the African Region, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) has established an Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG). This independent body serves as the principal advisory group to WHO AFRO for strategic guidance on all matters pertaining to public health emergency preparedness and response. The EPR Technical Advisory Group will play a critical role in supporting WHO African Member States to fortify health security in the face of diverse emergencies. Countries in the WHO African Region experience over 100 health emergencies annually which disrupt the economy and prosperity of communities and weaken already fragile health systems. With climate change and conflict aggravating more than half of Africa’s health emergencies, the next pandemic is not just a possibility, it's imminent. It is imperative, now more than ever, to enhance the Emergency Preparedness and Response capabilities within the Region. Composed of 16 distinguished experts (details below) from diverse fields like epidemiology, public health, global health, vaccinology, paediatrics, nutrition, internal medicine, infectious diseases, programme management, health-care administration, health economics, health communication, sociology, the EPR-TAG advises the WHO AFRO Regional Director on key issues. These include assessing the regional context of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies; conducting horizon scanning for new and emerging threats; providing strategic guidance on preparedness, response, and recovery strategies; reviewing progress in implementing regional health security initiatives; and strengthening country ownership and decision-making in emergency response. The EPR-TAG is chaired by Dr Deo Nshimirimana, a retired WHO medical doctor renowned for his expertise in immunization in emergency settings. Assisting him is Dr Rebecca Martin, Vice President of Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute, appointed as the Vice-Chairperson. Dr Martin brings decades of experience in health security, emergency response and immunization. Both leaders bring a wealth of experience in public health and will guide the EPR-TAG for an initial three-year term. ""The opportunity to lead the EPR-TAG is a great honour, and I am thrilled to be part of this transformative team. I am confident that our collective expertise will significantly contribute to enhancing Africa's preparedness and response capabilities, ensuring a more resilient defence against ongoing and future health threats. Together, we can make a substantial impact on the well-being of African nations."" - Dr Deo Nshimirimana. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, commented on the establishment of the EPR-TAG, stating: ""The Emergency Preparedness & Response technical group will play a critical role in strengthening our capacity, working collectively with partners, to support countries to prepare for, respond to, recover from public health emergencies while continuing to provide essential health care, across the African Region. I look forward, with our team, to leveraging its diverse expertise and independent perspective, for the benefit of our Member States."" The inaugural meeting of this prestigious group is taking place in Saly, Senegal from 16 to 17 July 2024. This gathering marks a historic moment as the EPR-TAG begins its journey to enhance health security across the African region. The establishment of the EPR-TAG underlines WHO AFRO's commitment to building a stronger, more resilient African Region prepared to face any public health challenge. With its expert guidance and collaborative approach, the EPR-TAG will play a vital role in protecting the health and well-being of millions of people across the continent.

"Road traffic deaths rise in the African region, but down globally, WHO report",2024-07-16,"Road traffic deaths rise in the African region, but down globally, WHO report 16 July 2024 Brazzaville/Nairobi – Road traffic death rates in the past decade have increased significantly in the African region, with almost 250 000 lives lost on the continent’s roads in 2021 alone. Conversely, global rates fell by 5% during the same period, a new World Health Organization (WHO) report shows. Between 2010 and 2021, the region recorded a 17% increase in road-related fatalities, according to the WHO Status report on road safety 2023 for the African region – the latest update. The region accounts for nearly one-fifth of all road deaths globally, despite being home to only 15% of the world’s population, and 3% of its vehicles. The report attributes the rise to multiple factors, including inadequate road safety laws and standards. No country in the region currently has laws that meet the best practice standards for the five key road safety behavioural risk factors: speeding, drink driving, non-use of motorcycle helmets, seatbelts and child restraints. “The findings of this report point to a serious public health concern for African countries, with hundreds of thousands of lives being lost unnecessarily. As WHO, we’re committed to working hand in hand with countries to tackle this preventable threat and continue to fully support all efforts to make our roads safer for motorists and pedestrians alike,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. According to the report, males aged between 15 and 64 years are the main victims of road traffic crashes. Vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians are worst affected, with road-related deaths of motorcyclists doubling in the past 10 years. Few countries have made progress to establish transport systems that cater to alternate modes of transport, such as bicycles, motorcycles or pedestrians, as well as efficient public transport. These so-called multimodal transport systems have been determined to be more equitable and environmentally-friendly, and safer for road users. Currently, Africa is one of the fastest growing markets for used vehicles. Since the 2013 Status report, total vehicle registration has almost doubled, while two- and three-wheel vehicle registration has tripled. Only 13 countries have national strategies to promote walking and cycling. Although there has been progress to introduce laws governing safety equipment in vehicles, pedestrian protection remains largely unaddressed. Additionally, road infrastructure safety ratings are notably low, with only a small percentage meeting acceptable standards for various road users, the report found. WHO is working with countries to strengthen the key road safety pillars, through advocacy, technical support, awareness-raising and training. This improved the capacity of countries, like Zambia, to collect and report road traffic deaths data. Currently, most road traffic data systems in Africa capture only road-related deaths, excluding information about injuries and their severity, including medium- and long-term consequences such as disability. Post-crash care services in the region are also inadequate or unavailable in most countries; fewer than one-third have services that meet recommended levels of access to pre-hospital care, emergency care, and treatment and rehabilitation services. To achieve the United Nations General Assembly target of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2030, WHO recommends concerted efforts to implement a range of interventions to strengthen national road safety strategies in Africa. These include policies that promote sustainable transportation systems, improved legislative road safety frameworks, investment in data management systems, improved post-crash response, and research tailored to the continent’s unique challenges.

WHO Steps Up Cross-Regional Efforts for Sudan’s Humanitarian Emergency,2024-07-10,"WHO Steps Up Cross-Regional Efforts for Sudan’s Humanitarian Emergency 10 July 2024 Adre – As millions flee war and hunger in Sudan, senior leadership from WHO’s Africa and Eastern Mediterranean Regions converged in Chad, which hosts the largest number of Sudanese refugees, to assess the urgent health needs of people impacted by this complex and deteriorating humanitarian crisis. The mission aims to optimize WHO operations in Chad, Sudan, and the offices of the African Region (AFRO) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) to serve affected communities with crucial medical care and scale up cross-border operations for humanitarian assistance into the Darfur states of Sudan. “As WHO’s Representative for Sudan, it is difficult to see this level of suffering among the refugees. They shared stories of violence, loss, and hunger. With the health system severely degraded – all 241 health facilities in Central Darfur have sustained damage – disease spreading, and famine looming, it is increasingly challenging to meet the soaring health needs. If we don’t act with urgency, we will see higher morbidity, mortality, and transgenerational impact of the current conflict,” said Dr. Shible Sahbani. Hunger is rising at devastating rates. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the global authority on famine, says Sudan is facing the worst levels of acute food insecurity ever recorded by the IPC in the country. In the last six months, the number of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity has increased by 45% from 17.7 million to 25.6 million. WHO’s cross-regional priorities include scaling up cross-border operations to Sudan, particularly into Darfur, which has been largely cut off from humanitarian assistance. But lack of access imposed by parties to the conflict and reduced resources – only 18% of the Sudan Humanitarian Response has been funded - severely constrains the response. Opening the Adre border crossing between Chad and Sudan to allow humanitarian supplies in would be lifesaving. WHO’s Representative in Chad, Dr. Anya Blanche, said: “The people of Chad have been incredibly hospitable and offered food, water, and shelter for the refugees coming in, but the needs are overwhelming. Our priority is to create integrated health systems for refugees and host populations that not only address immediate medical needs, but also develop Chad’s healthcare capacity in the long run so the future of the people is not dependent on aid.” The small town of Adre in Eastern Chad, originally home to 40 000 people, has seen a sixfold increase in its population. Over 600 000 Sudanese and 180 000 Chadian returnees have arrived in Adre since the beginning of the conflict in April 2023. Most refugees have survived multiple displacements as the violence that started in Khartoum escalated to different parts of Sudan. They have crossed the border with gunshot wounds, having survived rape and sexual violence, and walked for days without sufficient food for months. In mid-April, marking one year to the conflict, the number of people displaced by conflict was nearly 8.7 million. In three months alone, this has increased by over 45%, with 12.7 million people estimated to be displaced today. Over 10 million people are displaced within Sudan, while 2 million have sought refuge into six neighbouring countries. Dr. Thierno Baldé, Coordinator for WHO Regional Emergency Hub for West and Central Africa, said: “We have seen the suffering of the people here. They have nothing and are exposed to many diseases, including epidemic-prone diseases. Humanitarian aid actors are present, but funding is minimal. At WHO, we are working collectively between the two regions to make our operations as resource-efficient as possible. With the seasonal rains here, minimal shelter, and dismal living conditions, there are heightened fears of disease outbreaks such as malaria and cholera, that could lead to yet another layer of suffering. Regional Emergency Director for EMRO, Dr. Richard Brennan, stressed the need for global solidarity and attention. “This dynamic and catastrophic crisis is getting very little attention by the international community. We can do more, and we certainly need to do more.

Sierra Leone’s dedicated polio vaccinators hit roads to reach millions of children: ...,2024-06-27,"Sierra Leone’s dedicated polio vaccinators hit roads to reach millions of children: Ensuring every child in Pujehun is safe and free from polio 27 June 2024 Using door-to-door vaccination and fixed vaccination centers in health facilities, the World Health Organization supported over 4000 vaccinators and healthcare workers in May to ensure that every child in Seirra Leone was reached with two drops of the polio vaccine. This activity formed part of the national response campaign to polio outbreak and reached more than 3.3 million children under five years of age. Vaccinator Elizabeth Jane Jabati, explained that her and her colleagues’ efforts have built community trust and support for immunization services across the country. According to Elizabeth who has been vaccinating children for the past 5 years in Pujehun and surrounding areas, this round was no different from the previous exercises, “ensuring that families are well informed of the campaign makes them receptive. This collaborative approach between the vaccinators and the community is instrumental in overcoming hesitations among parents, leading to a successful campaign” Elizabeth is passionate about her work. During the vaccination trainings, we are not only taught how to administer the vaccine but the importance of engaging with the communities, especially mothers, about hygiene and the benefits of the vaccination"" Elizabeth recalls. ""For me, the community response motivates me to work harder, we work closely with mobilizers who prepare the communities We have nor registered refusals as such in my area we have achieved 100% reach for the targeted children”, said Elizabeth “I make sure to return even to places where we have already vaccinated children, to ensure no child is missed because they were not home at the time of vaccination. It is okay and normal to mark the home and return to it later.” Elizabeth and other vaccinator’s dedication reflect a shared commitment to eradicating polio out of Sierra Leone. Her work not only protects children from polio but also fosters trust and education within the community Amidst the recurring fuel shortages in the country, the Ministry of Health in partnership with WHO launched the second round of mass vaccination campaigns for polio in 16 districts in Sierra Leone. In 2024, approximately 3,347,723 million children under five years across 16 districts in Sierra Leone have been vaccinated with the oral polio vaccine."

WHO Africa releases groundbreaking guidance to boost fight against sickle cell disea...,2024-06-19,"WHO Africa releases groundbreaking guidance to boost fight against sickle cell disease 19 June 2024 Brazzaville – World Health Organization (WHO) in the African Region today released groundbreaking new guidance to help strengthen efforts to address the growing threat of sickle cell disease in the region. Significant for their integrated and holistic approach, the new technical documents offer detailed, actionable strategies and insights to support countries to improve quality of care, make treatment more accessible and boost overall health outcomes. Despite notable advances in sickle cell disease treatment globally, including newborn screening, hydroxyurea therapy, gene therapy, improved management strategies and expanded immunization programmes that have reduced mortality rates in higher-income countries, significant challenges remain in ensuring equitable access to these treatments in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in the African region. An estimated 240 000 children on the continent are born with sickle cell disease annually, up to 80% of whom will die from severe infections or acute chest syndrome before age five – the highest sickle cell disease-related childhood death rate worldwide. “As we continue the fight against sickle cell disease, we are confident that this guidance for countries will serve as a valuable new addition to their toolkit, specifically because the guidance is tailored to the African reality, where a multi-faceted approach is key,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. The new WHO Africa guidance documents, entitled Guidance Framework for Sickle Cell Disease Management and Harmonized Guide for Sickle Cell Disease Management in Africa, provide countries with strategic guidance for policies, comprehensive care plans and advocacy efforts. Together, these documents form the WHO SICKLE Package of Interventions for Sickle Cell Disease Management. The SICKLE package aims to provide a holistic and integrated approach to managing sickle cell disease, ensuring access to necessary interventions, promoting education and advocacy, enhancing the quality of care, and empowering patients and communities. Developed with financial support from the Government of Monaco, and other partners, the package reflects a combination of the latest research, best practices and innovative approaches to sickle cell disease management, making them essential tools for health care providers, policymakers and advocates alike. WHO Africa has been at the forefront of the fight against sickle cell disease since 2010, focusing its efforts on, among other things, disease interventions and their scale-up, and access to innovative treatment technologies and medicines. Progress to date includes the adoption by several countries of accurate and inexpensive point-of-care screening, together with the use of Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound screening. The availability in 11 countries of hydroxyurea, a medication that is extremely effective in preventing episodes of pain, consequently reducing visits to health care centres, is also significant. Despite the advances, major challenges persist. These range from limited health care infrastructure, lack of awareness and education and inadequate access to comprehensive care, limited newborn screening, poor research and development, and restricted access to advanced treatments.

Zeroing in on purposive targeting in oral cholera vaccination campaign,2024-06-14,"Zeroing in on purposive targeting in oral cholera vaccination campaign 14 June 2024 In the midst of a raging cholera outbreak in Sorgin, Nsanje, Kaombe Sugar Company finds itself at the epicenter of a public health crisis. Field workers, including long-time employee Michael Kajobe, face dire sanitation challenges as the absence of toilets and water washing mechanisms in sugarcane plantations forces them to resort to unhygienic practices. As of January 2023, the Sorgin Health Center has recorded over 114 cholera cases, with a staggering 42 cases traced back to employees of Kaombe Sugar Company. The severity of the situation has prompted an oral cholera vaccination team from Sorgin Health Center to take action, targeting the company's workforce.Despite the gravity of the situation, resistance to vaccination persists. Kajobe, a field worker with eight years of experience, exemplifies a larger demographic skeptical about the relevance of preventive measures. In January alone, he and many others refused the cholera vaccine, citing past vaccinations and a perceived lack of benefit.The vaccination team, led by Senior Health Surveillance Officer Joseph Jamieson, patiently awaits the noon gate opening for Kaombe Sugar Company employees. Jamieson, who played a crucial role during the cholera outbreak, expresses frustration at the resistance faced during previous interventions. He highlights the challenges of community engagement, citing leaders who fail to inform their communities and the prevalence of personal beliefs hindering vaccination efforts. In a compelling encounter between Jamieson and Kajobe, the health officer emphasizes the vaccine's safety and dispels misconceptions. He underscores the lasting risk of the cholera virus, lasting over five years, and the urgent need for vaccination in an environment lacking proper sanitation practices. Kajobe, initially reluctant, undergoes a transformation into a cholera vaccine advocate. He recognizes the vaccine's importance in safeguarding not only his life but also his family, economic stability, and the strained health system.The situation sheds light on broader issues of workplace sanitation, economic implications for workers falling ill, and the necessity for comprehensive public health interventions. As the vaccination team continues door-to-door mobilization, the hope is to bridge the gap between skepticism and understanding, ultimately mitigating the cholera crisis and promoting a healthier, more informed community.

African health leaders begin work on roadmap to reshape global health financing on t...,2024-06-13,"African health leaders begin work on roadmap to reshape global health financing on the continent 13 June 2024 Addis Ababa – More than 80 ministry of health experts, regional and global partners and civil society representatives have set in motion the development of a roadmap to catalyse action to reshape the health financing ecosystem in Africa, and make it fit-for-purpose towards 2030 and beyond. The meeting was convened by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, in partnership with the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the African Constituency Bureau of the Global Fund. The development of the roadmap marks an important step in the ongoing process of identifying ways to ensure that global health initiatives (GHIs) and other external funding partners are more effective, efficient and equitable in complementing domestic financing, to strengthen health system capacities, accelerate progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), and deliver health impact. Over the past two decades, GHIs such as Gavi, the Global Fund and the Global Financing Facility have contributed to enormous progress in protecting health and improving lives of people in Africa and across the world. However, important changes in health needs, financing and governance necessitate a renewed vision for how they support countries to deliver sustainable impact. “With the growing need for strong and resilient health systems that can adapt to emerging threats, while continuing to meet existing health needs, the imperative of optimizing the impact of available resources is becoming increasingly urgent to advance Africa towards universal health coverage,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa. Focusing on GHIs as an entry point and catalyst for change in the broader health financing ecosystem, the Lusaka Agenda, published on UHC Day on 12 December 2023, represented the culmination of a 14-month, multi-stakeholder process that captured consensus around five strategic shifts for the long-term evolution of GHIs. The roadmap for the implementation of the Lusaka Agenda implementation in Africa will set out priority actions to realize these shifts. “At the 37th African Union (summit in February, African leaders endorsed the establishment of an accountability mechanism within the AU architecture to ensure effective implementation of the Lusaka Agenda on the continent. Our discussions over the past two days began to give shape to what this might look like,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC. The draft roadmap will be refined over the coming months, before it is presented for consideration by ministers of health at the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, to be held in Brazzaville, Congo, in August this year. “The Lusaka Agenda will ensure long-term sustainability and will propel countries towards achieving UHC,” said Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, and co-chair of the Lusaka Agenda Working Group. To deliver more sustainable impact in the face of emerging threats such as climate change and conflicts, the key shifts highlighted in the Lusaka Agenda include a focus on strengthening primary health care by bolstering health systems, catalysing action on domestic financing, improving joint approaches to achieving health equity, and strategic and operational coherence among GHIs. The Lusaka Agenda also calls for improved coordination of approaches to products, reseach and development (R&D) and regional manufacturing, to address market and policy failures in global health. “The Lusaka Agenda is now moving from talk to action, led by countries, and GHIs are listening,” added Linda Mafu, the Global Fund’s head of Civil Society and Political Advocacy.

New framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa,2024-06-12,"New framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa 12 June 2024 A new, comprehensive framework has been launched to guide health authorities, policy-makers and other stakeholders towards elimination of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a public health problem in eastern Africa. Also known as kala-azar, VL is a deadly parasitic disease that causes fever, weight loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and – if untreated – death. Transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies, VL is endemic in 80 countries around the world. In 2022, eastern Africa accounted for 73% of global VL cases, half of which occurred in children aged under 15 years. The elimination framework outlines five main strategies for guiding VL elimination: (i) early diagnosis and treatment; (ii) integrated vector management; (iii) effective surveillance; (iv) advocacy, social mobilization and partnership-building; and (v) implementation and operational research. It also describes a stepwise process for implementing the main elimination phases and sets country and regional targets; these include a 90% reduction in VL burden in the eastern Africa sub-region to fewer than 1500 cases per year by 2030; detection and treatment of 90% of cases within 30 days of onset of symptoms by 2030; a 100% decline in VL deaths in children by 2030; 100% of VL–HIV patients started on antiretroviral therapy; and the detection, reporting and management of all post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases.

MPOX PRESS STATEMENT ,2024-06-10,"MPOX PRESS STATEMENT 10 June 2024 Mbabane- The Ministry of Health in Eswatini has heightened its emergency management systems in response to the escalating Mpox cases in neighboring South Africa. Given Eswatini’s geographical proximity and frequent cross-border movement with South Africa, the potential for disease transmission is high. Since June 2022, South Africa has reported over 25 Mpox cases, with 16 confirmed cases, including three fatalities, notified to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of June 26, 2024. These cases, predominantly affecting men aged 23 to 43 years, have emerged from three provinces, with no reported recent travel to Mpox outbreak regions, suggesting local transmission. These cases have been reported from KwaZulu-Natal with eight cases and two deaths, Gauteng with seven cases and one death, and the Western Cape with one case. While Eswatini has not yet recorded any suspected Mpox cases, the WHO continues to provide and develop technical guidelines to respond to Mpox across all pillars. This includes global and regional situational updates, support for readiness assessments, and assistance in developing a comprehensive Mpox contingency plan. Mpox, a notifiable disease, is one of the 13 public health threats monitored through the country’s weekly surveillance system. In response to the current situation, the country has implemented key interventions including heightened surveillance activities, public health education on infectious diseases including Mpox, increased screening at points of entry, and strengthening of local public health laboratory capacity. Health facilities are being sensitized on Mpox case management through workshops and clinical forums. Regional Public Health Emergency Response Teams are also being convened for sensitization on case investigation and contact tracing of suspected cases. In a press statement by Honorable Mduduzi Matsebula, the Minister of Health, urges the public to remain vigilant. Emphasis is placed on infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene, isolation, and reduced contact with infected individuals. The public is also advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any suspected symptoms of Mpox. “WHO has supported the country to conduct Mpox readiness assessment using the WHO Mpox checklist and will provide guidance on identified gaps from the exercise.

MPOX PRESS STATEMENT ,2024-06-10,"MPOX PRESS STATEMENT 10 June 2024 Mbabane- The Ministry of Health in Eswatini has heightened its emergency management systems in response to the escalating Mpox cases in neighboring South Africa. Given Eswatini’s geographical proximity and frequent cross-border movement with South Africa, the potential for disease transmission is high. Since June 2022, South Africa has reported over 25 Mpox cases, with 16 confirmed cases, including three fatalities, notified to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of June 26, 2024. These cases, predominantly affecting men aged 23 to 43 years, have emerged from three provinces, with no reported recent travel to Mpox outbreak regions, suggesting local transmission. These cases have been reported from KwaZulu-Natal with eight cases and two deaths, Gauteng with seven cases and one death, and the Western Cape with one case. While Eswatini has not yet recorded any suspected Mpox cases, the WHO continues to provide and develop technical guidelines to respond to Mpox across all pillars. This includes global and regional situational updates, support for readiness assessments, and assistance in developing a comprehensive Mpox contingency plan. Mpox, a notifiable disease, is one of the 13 public health threats monitored through the country’s weekly surveillance system. In response to the current situation, the country has implemented key interventions including heightened surveillance activities, public health education on infectious diseases including Mpox, increased screening at points of entry, and strengthening of local public health laboratory capacity. Health facilities are being sensitized on Mpox case management through workshops and clinical forums. Regional Public Health Emergency Response Teams are also being convened for sensitization on case investigation and contact tracing of suspected cases. In a press statement by Honorable Mduduzi Matsebula, the Minister of Health, urges the public to remain vigilant. Emphasis is placed on infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene, isolation, and reduced contact with infected individuals. The public is also advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any suspected symptoms of Mpox. “WHO has supported the country to conduct Mpox readiness assessment using the WHO Mpox checklist and will provide guidance on identified gaps from the exercise. We remain on high alert and ready to offer technical support to the Ministry of Health” – WHO Representative, Dr Susan Tembo More information on Monkeypox (who.int)"
Environmental Health Workers on the Frontlines of Zimbabwe's Cholera Outbreak,2024-06-02,"Environmental Health Workers on the Frontlines of Zimbabwe's Cholera Outbreak 02 June 2024 Mutare – The number of cholera cases in Zimbabwe is declining thanks to the expanded and decentralized cholera response activities undertaken by the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC), supported by WHO and other partners. While current figures remain higher compared to the same period last year, this reduction is a welcome development, given the alarming surge between November 2023 and January this year. At the peak of the outbreak in Manicaland Province, Lovemore Mudzingwa, an Environmental Health Practitioner (EHP) at Zvipiripiri Rural Health Centre, played a critical role. He tirelessly responded to rumors in the community, providing essential information and disinfecting homes of suspected patients after assisting with their transportation to the clinic. Driven by a commitment to making a difference, Lovemore works hard to ensure his community has accurate information on cholera and other diseases. He actively identifies and addresses potential contamination sources, conducting regular inspections of water and food facilities to enforce hygiene standards. ""Our responsibility extends beyond responding to outbreaks,"" says Lovemore. ""We strive to prevent them altogether. By educating communities on the importance of safe water, sanitation, and hygiene practices, we empower them to protect themselves and their families from cholera."" Lovemore's dedication saved lives. In Mutorera Village, Zvipiripiri, his intervention helped 11 members of a single family survive cholera, with one succumbing to the disease. One survivor, 21-year-old Clara Marime**, expresses her deep appreciation for Lovemore and the other health workers at Zvipiripiri. Coming from a religious group that often avoids modern medicine, her experience was particularly challenging. ""I'm grateful to be alive,"" she narrates. ""By the time I reached the clinic, I was completely disoriented. I only realized where I was a day later."" While their efforts often go unnoticed, EHPs play a vital role in cholera outbreaks. They manage funerals during outbreaks, coordinate emergency response efforts, and provide crucial support to affected communities. From setting up cholera treatment centers to conducting contact tracing and disease surveillance, their expertise is vital for containing the spread of the disease and saving lives, not just from cholera. Since February 12th, 2024, Zimbabwe has been grappling with a cholera outbreak. As of 11 May 2024, a total of 33,914 suspected cholera cases have been reported nationwide, with 87 confirmed deaths, 623 suspected deaths, and 3,963 confirmed cases. Manicaland Province alone recorded 6,596 cases during the same period. In Zvipiripiri, WHO leveraged funding from the Health Resilience Fund (HRF) to strengthen the cholera treatment center. The facility was expanded from eight beds to twelve and provided essential medical supplies like rehydration fluids, antibiotics, and other cholera-specific treatment materials. Additionally, WHO supported the installation of sanitation facilities like waste pits and emergency latrines to promote hygiene and prevent further transmission. Triage points were also established to ensure an organized flow of patients and staff, minimizing infection risks. Furthermore, in November 2023, WHO provided the province with essential supplies including medicines, personal protective equipment (PPE), information, education, and communication (IEC) materials, and cleaning and disinfection supplies to bolster response efforts. In addition, WHO, with the support from HRF and Central Emergency Response Fund (UNCERF), spearheaded training programmes for EHPs, reaching over 60 individuals from all districts across the country. These trainings focused on water quality monitoring, equipping EHPs with the knowledge and skills to effectively test and analyze water samples. To further strengthen water quality surveillance in communities and especially in CTCs, WHO procured and distributed water quality kits and consumables. Additionally, WHO provided training on food safety for 115 EHPs, empowering them with current food trends, standards, and knowledge on foodborne illnesses. They gained valuable skills in preventing and controlling cholera and other diarrheal diseases, including vital measures to be implemented in communities and CTCs. On the job mentorship to EHPs on infection prevention and control and community engagement activities in CTCs and communities in response to the cholera outbreak is still being provided. “The significant decline in cholera cases in Zimbabwe is a testament to the collective efforts of the MoHCC, WHO, and other partners. However, our work is far from over. We must continue to support communities to strengthen prevention efforts to ensure a lasting impact on public health,” notes Dr Sally-Ann Ohene, WHO Zimbabwe Cholera Incident Manager. **Names changed to protect identity of the contributor.

Stronger control efforts help to lower tobacco use in African region,2024-05-31,"Stronger control efforts help to lower tobacco use in African region 31 May 2024 Brazzaville – Tobacco use among adolescents in the African region declined by nearly 18% between 2020 and 2022, and by 46% among adults during the same period as countries adopt stronger measures to control the use of tobacco. The African region is on track to achieve 30% relative reduction in tobacco use prevalence by 2025 compared with 2010, according to the Fifth Edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Report on Trends in Prevalence of Tobacco Use 2000–2030 report released in January 2024. In addition, 22 of the 56 countries worldwide on course to meet the target are in Africa. In 2014, the World Health Assembly adopted a global target of 30% relative reduction in tobacco use. With support from WHO and partners, countries in the African region have introduced robust tobacco laws and regulations, including stringent controls on marketing strategies for new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products, many of which are designed to attract young people. This year, World No Tobacco Day is being commemorated under the theme ""Protecting children from tobacco industry interference”. The theme aimed to mobilize international efforts to shield youth from harmful tobacco and nicotine products and the deceptive strategies applied by the tobacco industry to market their products to them. “Countries in the African region are making commendable progress in building safeguards against tobacco use and shielding populations from its harmful impacts. We now need to capitalize on the growing momentum to ensure a healthier future for the younger generation,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. In the African region, 96% of countries have now ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, with Mauritius becoming the first African country to fully implement the entire WHO MPOWER package of tobacco control measures to curb demand. The country is also the first in the region to implement plain packages for cigarette packs. In addition, 37 African countries now have bans on public smoking in force, with 14 of these instituting 100% smoke-free laws in all public places. A further 16 countries have introduced graphic health warnings on tobacco products, a cost-effective and powerful way to boost public awareness of associated health risks. In Mauritania, this contributed to a reduction in tobacco use among people aged from 16 to 64 years, from 18% to 10% between 2012 and 2021. Leveraging cost as a deterrent, WHO supported countries to institute progressive tobacco tax policies, resulting in price increases in 13 countries in the past five years. In effect, the average total tax share of the retail price of most tobacco brands across the region rose from 37% in 2016, to 41% in 2023. WHO also introduced innovative measures to counter increasing tobacco leaf production, encouraging over 5000 tobacco farmers in Kenya and Zambia to switch to alternative crops. This had the dual benefit of reducing tobacco production, while promoting food and nutrition security, environmental protection, and women empowerment and gender equity. While the African region is witnessing declining use of tobacco, the rapid population growth is still preventing notable reductions from translating to lower actual numbers of users, according to the WHO report. The focus on further reductions in tobacco use among adolescents is key, given that the sustainability of the tobacco and nicotine market relies heavily on recruiting new, young users. The tobacco industry continues to target the African region as a viable investment destination not only because of its young population, but also its rapidly growing economies, cheap labour and access to land for tobacco cultivation.

"Timely outbreak response, enhanced surveillance halts wild poliovirus transmission i...",2024-05-14,"Timely outbreak response, enhanced surveillance halts wild poliovirus transmission in Southern Africa 14 May 2024 Brazzaville/Lilongwe/Maputo – Following thorough assessments in Malawi and Mozambique, an independent Polio Outbreak Response Assessment Team (OBRA) today recommended the closure of the wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak in Malawi and Mozambique, marking a significant milestone in the fight against polio in the African region. The last WPV1 case in the African Region, linked to a strain circulating in Pakistan, was reported in Mozambique´s Tete Province in August 2022. A total of nine cases were detected in Mozambique and neighbouring Malawi, where the outbreak was declared in February 2022. In a coordinated response, more than 50 million children have been vaccinated to date against the virus in 5 countries in southern Africa. The meticulous evaluation carried out by the OBRA team included two in-depth field reviews and supplementary data review, concluding that there is no evidence of ongoing wild polio transmission. The assessment considered the quality of the outbreak response, including the overall population immunity, supplementary immunization campaigns, routine immunization coverage, surveillance systems, vaccine management practices, and the level of community engagement. The successful stopping of this outbreak reflects the unwavering commitment and collaborative efforts of African governments, health workers, communities and Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, including the invaluable support of Rotarians on the ground. Through robust surveillance, quality vaccination campaigns and enhanced community engagement, both countries have effectively controlled the spread of the virus, safeguarding the health and well-being of their children. ""This achievement is a testament to what can be accomplished when we work together with dedication and determination,"" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. ""I commend the governments of Malawi and Mozambique, as well as all those involved in the response, for their tireless efforts to contain the outbreak. It is now imperative that we continue to strengthen our immunization systems, enhance surveillance, and reach every child with life-saving vaccines."" Health authorities, with high-quality technical support from GPEI, have put in place national prevention strategies in Malawi and Mozambique, as well as in all districts bordering other countries involved in the response. These include Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Zambia. To date, more than 100 million vaccine doses have been administered in the most at-risk areas. The strategy to get ahead of this outbreak and stop it before it got out of hand relied on detailed micro-planning, including mapping of cross-border communities, migratory routes, cross-border entry/exit points, and transit routes for each of the cross-border facilities. Synchronization and coordination of vaccination plans across five countries, as well as the monitoring of vaccination activities, proved key to identifying and reaching all eligible children in the cross-border areas, to avoid the risk of paralysis due to the virus. ""The official closure of the outbreak is truly a success due to unfaltering determination and strong collaboration between the governments of Mozambique, Malawi and neighbouring countries, as well as between all partners and health workers. I want to particularly recognise the strong efforts of the vaccination teams working on the frontline to reach every last child,” said Etleva Kadilli, UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa. “Going forward, routine immunisation must remain high up the priority list; no child is safe from polio until all children are vaccinated."" To enhance polio surveillance, over the past two years, 15 new wastewater surveillance sites were established in the affected countries. These sites have a critical role to play in detecting silent circulating poliovirus in wastewater, ensuring that quality samples are sent to laboratories for timely confirmation and response to poliovirus presence. Additionally, countries have scaled up efforts to protect children in high-risk areas by strengthening surveillance, and data and information management. World Health Organization (WHO) in the African Region’s Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Centre has analysed spatial and geographic data on visual maps, providing geographic real-time coverage information, including locating missing settlements, to improve vaccination coverage. ""Closing polio outbreaks is possible when national governments, local health workers, community mobilizers, and global partners come together to prioritize a rapid and timely response to protect children from this devastating disease,"" said Dr. Chris Elias, president of Global Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ""Malawi, Mozambique, and the entire Southern-African region are setting the example for what it takes to urgently improve vaccination campaigns and disease surveillance systems. Commitments like these will help us achieve a world free of all forms of poliovirus."" Health experts, the OBRA team and GPEI coordinators on the ground underscored the pivotal role of enhanced polio surveillance, high quality community engagement in vaccination campaigns and timely outbreak response, including rapid deployment of experts and other field responders, to curb the virus. Note to editors: The notification of imported wild poliovirus in 2022 did not alter the certification of the African region as free of indigenous wild polio in August 2020, as the strain that was confirmed in southern Africa was imported. Polio has no cure and can cause irreversible paralysis. However, the disease can be prevented and eradicated through administration of a safe, simple and effective vaccine. As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, ensure the vaccination of residents and long-term visitors and restrict at the point of departure travel of individuals, who have not been vaccinated or cannot prove the vaccination status. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is spearheaded by national governments, WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), UNICEF, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Since 1988, the incidence of wild poliovirus has been reduced by more than 99%, from more 350,000 annual cases in more than 125 endemic countries, to four cases in 2024 from two endemic countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan).

Enhancing capacity for malaria vaccine introduction and rollout in Africa through ex...,2024-05-08,"Enhancing capacity for malaria vaccine introduction and rollout in Africa through experience sharing 08 May 2024 Accra, Ghana - Since 2019, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi have been rolling out malaria vaccines, with over 2.5 million children already receiving at least one dose of the life-saving vaccine that is protecting children from deadly malaria. In 2024, more than 20 countries in Africa are to introduce the vaccine into routine immunization, with Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Benin, Liberia and Sierra Leone already leading the way. The scale-up of malaria vaccines in Africa will increase access to malaria prevention and save tens of thousands of young lives every year. As part of efforts to support the wider introduction and rollout of the malaria vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO), PATH and other partners convened stakeholders from Nigeria, Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire and Liberia to learn from Ghana’s malaria vaccination experience on 16-18 April in Accra, Ghana, and ensure adequate preparation towards new introductions and rollout across these countries. Drawn from ministries of health, WHO and UNICEF, participants also benefitted from the experience of other countries that have already introduced the vaccines such as Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Sierra Leone. “Having been delivering malaria vaccine to children across seven regions, Ghana’s experience and lessons will be key to the introduction and rollout of the vaccine in countries that are yet to introduce,” says Dr Frank Lule, the Officer-In-Charge of WHO Ghana. Participants gained insights into vaccine introduction, risk communication, readiness monitoring, supervision, and data management among others. Additionally, a field visit to malaria vaccination centers was organized to provide participants with firsthand experience in Ghana’s vaccination process. “In workshops like this, when we exchange information, the result and the impact tend to be greater efficiency with the resources that we have to reach children and to vaccinate,” says Evan Simpson, Director of Vaccine Implementation, PATH. As Africa continues to shoulder 94% of the global malaria burden, the WHO and its partners are strengthening malaria control efforts with vaccines being the latest in the control toolbox. In January 2024, the WHO Regional Office for Africa established the Accelerating Malaria Vaccine Introduction and Rollout in Africa (AMVIRA). This initiative aims to strengthen the provision of state-of-the-art technical support to Member States in their efforts to introduce and roll out malaria vaccines while strengthening partners’ coordination at national, regional, and global levels effectively and efficiently. WHO and partners also leveraged the workshop to address information gaps and share lessons and best practices to ensure successful vaccine introduction and rollout in countries that are yet to do so. For participants, the knowledge gained from the country peer learning workshop will help shape their strategies towards effective malaria vaccine rollout. “One of the key lessons I have picked up from Ghana’s experiences is the role of effective coordination and collaboration. Though we have a coordination team, we are going to strengthen this team through the addition of more stakeholders, including communities and civil society organizations,” says Dr Yao Kossia Deputy Manager, the Expanded Vaccination Programme, Côte d'Ivoire. Highlighting the significance of the knowledge gained, Dr Garba Ahmed-Rufai, the Director for Disease Control and Immunization of Nigeria noted “What we have learned is programming in terms of the rollout, and the timing of the doses, and the lessons learnt. And knowing what the problems are from the other countries, we would just adjust accordingly, so that we can overcome all of that”. In addition to facilitating cross-learning, WHO through the AMVIRA initiative is enhancing the capacity of countries to ensure effective introductions and rollout. There has been the deployment of experts in Immunization, data management, risk communication, and external communication to assist 5 countries in efficiently planning and delivering vaccines. A similar workshop has been held in Cameroon, with more countries expected to participate in other workshops in Benin and Malawi.

Namibia reaches key milestone in eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV and...,2024-05-06,"Namibia reaches key milestone in eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV and hepatitis B 06 May 2024 Windhoek – Namibia has become the first country in Africa – and the first high-burden country in the world - to reach a significant milestone on the path towards eliminating vertical mother-to-child transmission of both HIV and viral hepatitis B. Eastern and Southern Africa is home to more than half the world’s HIV burden and Africa accounts for two thirds of new hepatitis B infections globally. Namibia is home to more than 200 000 people living with HIV and new infections disproportionately impact females. Progress is possible. Globally, 2.5 million children have avoided vertical transmission of HIV since 2010, 28 000 of whom are in Namibia. HIV testing among pregnant women is almost universally available across the country and access to treatment has led to a 70% reduction of vertical transmission in the last 20 years. In 2022, only 4% cent of babies born to mothers living with HIV acquired the virus. Almost 80% of infants received a timely birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, one of the key metrics of success on the path to elimination. Namibia has integrated primary health care with antenatal, child health and sexual and reproductive health services. The government committed stable domestic finance to national health programmes, offering widely accessible, quality and free of charge clinical services and support. Based on specified criteria, the World Health Organization (WHO) has awarded Namibia “silver tier” status for progress on reducing hepatitis B and “bronze tier” for progress on HIV. Namibia’s achievement follows a concerted strategy to curb the transmission of hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis. WHO's Triple Elimination Initiative aims to safeguard the health of mothers and children and affirm the rights of every child to be born free from the burden of these viruses. “This is a landmark achievement by Namibia that demonstrates the life-saving possibilities of committed political leadership and effective implementation of public health priorities,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “With concerted efforts, we can accelerate progress to reach the goals of ending mother-to-child transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis – the triple elimination.” The validation process, led by WHO in collaboration with UNICEF, UNAIDS and UNFPA, evaluates data and standardizes milestones for eliminating diseases. Among other factors, WHO certifies a country as having attained silver tier status when the hepatitis B vaccine is given to 50% or more newborn babies. Bronze certification is awarded to countries which have reduced the vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child to less than 5%. “In many countries we are failing our children by not reaching them with the same treatment with which we reach their mothers and other adults,” said Anne Githuku-Shongwe, UNAIDS Regional Director, East and Southern Africa. “Namibia has fought against this injustice and we are proud to celebrate their immense effort to leave no child behind. They serve as a beacon for the entire region.” The triple Elimination Initiative promotes an end to vertical transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus, all of which are prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. It encourages countries to integrate services, using a person-centred approach to improve health outcomes for mothers and children. “Namibia has met this milestone by taking a truly integrated approach to the HIV response from early on,” said Etleva Kadilli, UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa. “The country has not addressed HIV in isolation as a single disease, but as part of a broader health and development agenda, encompassing maternal and child health for all. Namibia has reached mothers and their children, even in the most rural areas.” Namibia’s first National Elimination Strategy was initiated in 2014, followed by the National Roadmap to Elimination of HIV and syphilis in 2020, with viral hepatitis B added later. Namibia established a multisectoral National Validation Committee, in line with WHO guidance, for elimination of the three diseases.

African region’s first-ever health workforce investment charter launched,2024-05-06,"African region’s first-ever health workforce investment charter launched 06 May 2024 Windhoek – The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa and partner organizations today launched the region’s first-ever health investment charter that aims to align and drive sustainable investment in the health workforce. With a bold target of halving the African region’s critical 6.1-million health workforce shortage by 2030, the African Health Workforce Investment Charter will mobilize and align domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow and retain the continent’s health workforce, especially in rural and primary health care settings. “Any discussion about the delivery of health care services must acknowledge that, for these services to be rendered and rendered effectively, we need feet on the ground,” said Honourable Dr Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila, Namibia’s Prime Minister. “For the health professionals to do their work effectively, they must be well resourced and capacitated in the best ways possible.” In addition to shortages, the African region faces many other health workforce challenges, including, rising unemployment, excessive out-migration and low quality of training. Low health investment and limited prioritization of the health workforce have critically exposed health systems. Investment in health, especially from domestic sources, is still low and inadequate for many countries to meet the universal health coverage and ensure health security “The numbers of Africans who have left the continent in search of greener pastures in other parts of the world are staggering. It is a matter that needs to be addressed as a top priority for African governments and indeed all those who wish to see a shift in the historical as well as current trends,” said Honourable Dr Kalumbi Shangula, Minister of Health and Social Services of Namibia. The charter launched today brought together the health workforce investment efforts of all stakeholders, including national governments, the private health sector, civil society, external financing institutions and development partners in Africa. “By investing in the health workforce, we not only address the challenges within the sector but also generate dividends in education, employment and gender equality,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “These investments will contribute to our sustained efforts in attracting more resources and improving the quality of our health workforce.” Investing in the health workforce will have positive spin-offs in the form of decent jobs, particularly for women and youth who often face barriers to employment. By providing opportunities for education, training and career progression, the Charter will immensely contribute to the economic empowerment of these demographics and fundamentally support inclusive economic growth. Additionally, health labour force investment also brings multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage. For every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, and that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%. “Studies show that investments in the health sector yield substantial economic returns, estimating a nine-to-one return on investment. The new narrative that we are promoting is to transform the health sector to move from liability to an asset for the economy of our countries,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024. Efforts will continue to be made to engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.

Call for Experts:  Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-...,2024-04-30,"WHO Ghana/Nii Ray Lamptey Credits Call for Experts: Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B 30 April 2024 Issued on: 30/04/2024 Deadline: 28/05/2024 The World Health Organization (WHO) is seeking experts to serve as members one of the Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B. This “Call for experts” provides information about the advisory group in question, the expert profiles being sought, the process to express interest, and the process of selection. Background The global community has committed to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a public health priority. The purpose of the elimination goal is to ensure the availability of quality reproductive and maternal and child health (MCH) services to reduce and control the transmission of HIV, syphilis and HBV between mothers and their offspring and to provide the best available treatment to the mother, such that new infections are reduced to a very low level and ceases to be a public health concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) released the first edition of the guideline for global validation of elimination of mother-to-child (eMTCT) transmission HIV and syphilis in 2014. The guidance was further updated in 2017 to include revised validation criteria for eMTCT of HIV, an expanded description of the surveillance case definition of congenital syphilis, criteria for evaluation of human rights, gender equality and community engagement, etc. In 2021, the third edition of the guideline was released which includes validation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) eMTCT, underlining the importance of elimination of eMTCT of three infections, HIV, Syphilis and HBV. The guidelines provide standardized processes and consensus-developed criteria to validate eMTCT of HIV, HBV and Syphilis, and emphasize country-led accountability, multilevel collaboration, including engagement of women living with HIV or HBV. Validation is a term used to attest that a country has successfully met the criteria for eMTCT of HIV and/or Syphilis and/or HBV. Processes for validation of eMTCT or Path to Elimination (PTE) The achievement of elimination of eMTCT or vertical transmission, of HIV, syphilis and HBV is a tremendous accomplishment, requiring health ministry–led accountability, rigorous data analysis, intensive programme assessment and multilevel collaboration at the national, regional, and global levels of a set of impact and process indicators and the fulfilment of the four foundational requirements for (i) data quality (ii) strong programmes (iii) laboratory quality and (iv) human rights, gender equality and community engagement. Impact targets for validation Mother to child transmission (MTCT) rate of HIV of <2% in non-breastfeeding populations or <5% in breastfeeding populations New paediatric HIV infections due to MTCT of ≤50 cases per 100 000 live births Congenital Syphilis rate of ≤50 per 100 000 live births Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence of ≤0.1% in the ≤5-year-old birth cohort (and older children) In countries that provide targeted timely HepB-BD (Birth Dose), an additional impact target of HBV MTCT rate of ≤2% The process for validation requires validation structures at national, regional and global levels. As per WHO governance guidance, at national level, a National Validation Secretariat (NVS), and National Validation Committee (NVC) should be established and engage with the Ministry of Health, WHO Country Office, women living with HIV and relevant United Nations partners such as UNAIDS, UNICEF and UNFPA. At the regional level, WHO regional office should host a Regional Validation Secretariat (RVS), which works in close partnership with UNAIDS, UNICEF and other relevant United Nations partners. WHO will establish and convene the Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B in the World Health Organization African Region (WHO AFRO) and shall provide the secretariat for the RVC, including necessary scientific, technical, administrative and other support. At the global level, the Global Validation Secretariat (GVS) and the Global Validation Advisory Committee (GVAC) are involved in the validation process. At all levels, committee members should have experience in one of the four foundational requirements for validation and should be able to act independently when reviewing and assessing whether a country has achieved or maintained the elimination targets. Committee members at all levels should serve as independent experts and not represent government or nongovernmental entities in their position. Functions of the Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B In its capacity as an advisory body to WHO, the RVC shall have the following functions: To review national validation reports from the National Validation Committee (NVC) to determine and advise WHO on their compliance with the global criteria for validation of eMTCT through expert desk review and in-country mission or virtual validation assessment using the validation assessment tools; To liaise with the RVS to request and receive additional information and clarifications; To advise WHO on how countries could address gaps or barriers to global validation identified through the evaluation process; To prepare the regional validation report to inform WHO regarding compliance with global criteria for validation of eMTCT; To advise WHO as to whether candidate countries’ achievements in eMTCT of HIV, HBV and Syphilis can be recommended for validation; To provide feedback to WHO on the validation assessment tools; To support WHO in the determination of detailed operational practices including evaluation approach and methods, organization of in-country missions or virtual validation assessments and communicating with the NVS, NVC and global partners. Operations of the Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B The RVC shall normally meet at least once each year. However, WHO may convene additional meetings. RVC meetings may be held in person (at WHO AFRO offices in Brazzaville or another location, as determined by WHO) or virtually, via video or teleconference. RVC meetings may be held in open and/or closed session, as decided by the Chairperson in consultation with WHO. Open sessions: Open sessions shall be convened for the sole purpose of the exchange of non-confidential information and views and may be attended by Observers (as defined in paragraph III.3 below). Closed sessions: The sessions dealing with the formulation of recommendations and/or advice to WHO shall be restricted to the members of the RVC and essential WHO Secretariat staff. The quorum for RVC meetings shall be two thirds of the members. WHO may, at its sole discretion, invite external individuals from time to time to attend the open sessions of an advisory group, or parts thereof, as “observers”. Observers may be invited either in their personal capacity, or as representatives from a governmental institution / intergovernmental organization, or from a non-State actor. WHO will request observers invited in their personal capacity to complete a confidentiality undertaking and a declaration of interests form prior to attending a session of the advisory group. Invitations to observers attending as representatives from non-State actors will be subject to WHO internal due diligence and risk assessment including conflict of interest considerations in accordance with the Framework for engagement with non-State actors (FENSA). Observers invited as representatives may also be requested to complete a confidentiality undertaking. Observers shall normally attend meetings of the RVC at their own expense and be responsible for making all arrangements in that regard. At the invitation of the Chairperson, observers may be asked to present their personal views and/or the policies of their organization. Observers will not participate in the process of adopting recommendations of the RVC. The RVC may decide to establish smaller working groups (sub-groups of the RVC) to work on specific issues. Their deliberations shall take place via teleconference or video-conference. For these sub-groups, no quorum requirement will apply; the outcome of their deliberations will be submitted to the RVC for review at one of its meetings. RVC members are expected to attend meetings. If a member misses two consecutive meetings, WHO may end his/her appointment as a member of the RVC. Reports of each meeting and an yearly report shall be submitted by the RVC to WHO (the Regional Director ). All recommendations from the RVC are advisory to WHO, who retains full control over any subsequent decisions or actions regarding any proposals, policy issues or other matters considered by the RVC. The RVC shall normally make recommendations by consensus. If, in exceptional circumstances, a consensus on a particular issue cannot be reached, minority opinions will be reflected in the meeting report. Active participation is expected from all RVC members, including in working groups, teleconferences, and interaction over email. RVC members may, in advance of RVC meetings, be requested to review meeting materials and to provide their views for consideration by the RVC. WHO shall determine the modes of communication by the RVC, including between WHO and the RVC members, and the RVC members among themselves. RVC members shall not speak on behalf of, or represent, the RVC or WHO to any third party. Who can express interest? The Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B will be multidisciplinary, with members who have a range of technical knowledge, skills and experience relevant to the underlisted areas. Approximately 15 members may be selected.

Call for Experts:  Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-...,2024-04-30,"Call for Experts: Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B 30 April 2024 Issued on: 30/04/2024 Deadline: 28/05/2024 The World Health Organization (WHO) is seeking experts to serve as members one of the Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B. This “Call for experts” provides information about the advisory group in question, the expert profiles being sought, the process to express interest, and the process of selection. Background The global community has committed to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a public health priority. The purpose of the elimination goal is to ensure the availability of quality reproductive and maternal and child health (MCH) services to reduce and control the transmission of HIV, syphilis and HBV between mothers and their offspring and to provide the best available treatment to the mother, such that new infections are reduced to a very low level and ceases to be a public health concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) released the first edition of the guideline for global validation of elimination of mother-to-child (eMTCT) transmission HIV and syphilis in 2014. The guidance was further updated in 2017 to include revised validation criteria for eMTCT of HIV, an expanded description of the surveillance case definition of congenital syphilis, criteria for evaluation of human rights, gender equality and community engagement, etc. In 2021, the third edition of the guideline was released which includes validation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) eMTCT, underlining the importance of elimination of eMTCT of three infections, HIV, Syphilis and HBV. The guidelines provide standardized processes and consensus-developed criteria to validate eMTCT of HIV, HBV and Syphilis, and emphasize country-led accountability, multilevel collaboration, including engagement of women living with HIV or HBV. Validation is a term used to attest that a country has successfully met the criteria for eMTCT of HIV and/or Syphilis and/or HBV. Processes for validation of eMTCT or Path to Elimination (PTE) The achievement of elimination of eMTCT or vertical transmission, of HIV, syphilis and HBV is a tremendous accomplishment, requiring health ministry–led accountability, rigorous data analysis, intensive programme assessment and multilevel collaboration at the national, regional, and global levels of a set of impact and process indicators and the fulfilment of the four foundational requirements for (i) data quality (ii) strong programmes (iii) laboratory quality and (iv) human rights, gender equality and community engagement. Impact targets for validation Mother to child transmission (MTCT) rate of HIV of <2% in non-breastfeeding populations or <5% in breastfeeding populations New paediatric HIV infections due to MTCT of ≤50 cases per 100 000 live births Congenital Syphilis rate of ≤50 per 100 000 live births Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence of ≤0.1% in the ≤5-year-old birth cohort (and older children) In countries that provide targeted timely HepB-BD (Birth Dose), an additional impact target of HBV MTCT rate of ≤2% The process for validation requires validation structures at national, regional and global levels. As per WHO governance guidance, at national level, a National Validation Secretariat (NVS), and National Validation Committee (NVC) should be established and engage with the Ministry of Health, WHO Country Office, women living with HIV and relevant United Nations partners such as UNAIDS, UNICEF and UNFPA. At the regional level, WHO regional office should host a Regional Validation Secretariat (RVS), which works in close partnership with UNAIDS, UNICEF and other relevant United Nations partners. WHO will establish and convene the Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B in the World Health Organization African Region (WHO AFRO) and shall provide the secretariat for the RVC, including necessary scientific, technical, administrative and other support. At the global level, the Global Validation Secretariat (GVS) and the Global Validation Advisory Committee (GVAC) are involved in the validation process. At all levels, committee members should have experience in one of the four foundational requirements for validation and should be able to act independently when reviewing and assessing whether a country has achieved or maintained the elimination targets. Committee members at all levels should serve as independent experts and not represent government or nongovernmental entities in their position. Functions of the Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B In its capacity as an advisory body to WHO, the RVC shall have the following functions: To review national validation reports from the National Validation Committee (NVC) to determine and advise WHO on their compliance with the global criteria for validation of eMTCT through expert desk review and in-country mission or virtual validation assessment using the validation assessment tools; To liaise with the RVS to request and receive additional information and clarifications; To advise WHO on how countries could address gaps or barriers to global validation identified through the evaluation process; To prepare the regional validation report to inform WHO regarding compliance with global criteria for validation of eMTCT; To advise WHO as to whether candidate countries’ achievements in eMTCT of HIV, HBV and Syphilis can be recommended for validation; To provide feedback to WHO on the validation assessment tools; To support WHO in the determination of detailed operational practices including evaluation approach and methods, organization of in-country missions or virtual validation assessments and communicating with the NVS, NVC and global partners. Operations of the Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B The RVC shall normally meet at least once each year. However, WHO may convene additional meetings. RVC meetings may be held in person (at WHO AFRO offices in Brazzaville or another location, as determined by WHO) or virtually, via video or teleconference. RVC meetings may be held in open and/or closed session, as decided by the Chairperson in consultation with WHO. Open sessions: Open sessions shall be convened for the sole purpose of the exchange of non-confidential information and views and may be attended by Observers (as defined in paragraph III.3 below). Closed sessions: The sessions dealing with the formulation of recommendations and/or advice to WHO shall be restricted to the members of the RVC and essential WHO Secretariat staff. The quorum for RVC meetings shall be two thirds of the members. WHO may, at its sole discretion, invite external individuals from time to time to attend the open sessions of an advisory group, or parts thereof, as “observers”. Observers may be invited either in their personal capacity, or as representatives from a governmental institution / intergovernmental organization, or from a non-State actor. WHO will request observers invited in their personal capacity to complete a confidentiality undertaking and a declaration of interests form prior to attending a session of the advisory group. Invitations to observers attending as representatives from non-State actors will be subject to WHO internal due diligence and risk assessment including conflict of interest considerations in accordance with the Framework for engagement with non-State actors (FENSA). Observers invited as representatives may also be requested to complete a confidentiality undertaking. Observers shall normally attend meetings of the RVC at their own expense and be responsible for making all arrangements in that regard. At the invitation of the Chairperson, observers may be asked to present their personal views and/or the policies of their organization. Observers will not participate in the process of adopting recommendations of the RVC. The RVC may decide to establish smaller working groups (sub-groups of the RVC) to work on specific issues. Their deliberations shall take place via teleconference or video-conference. For these sub-groups, no quorum requirement will apply; the outcome of their deliberations will be submitted to the RVC for review at one of its meetings. RVC members are expected to attend meetings. If a member misses two consecutive meetings, WHO may end his/her appointment as a member of the RVC. Reports of each meeting and an yearly report shall be submitted by the RVC to WHO (the Regional Director ). All recommendations from the RVC are advisory to WHO, who retains full control over any subsequent decisions or actions regarding any proposals, policy issues or other matters considered by the RVC. The RVC shall normally make recommendations by consensus. If, in exceptional circumstances, a consensus on a particular issue cannot be reached, minority opinions will be reflected in the meeting report. Active participation is expected from all RVC members, including in working groups, teleconferences, and interaction over email. RVC members may, in advance of RVC meetings, be requested to review meeting materials and to provide their views for consideration by the RVC. WHO shall determine the modes of communication by the RVC, including between WHO and the RVC members, and the RVC members among themselves. RVC members shall not speak on behalf of, or represent, the RVC or WHO to any third party. Who can express interest? The Regional Validation Committee (RVC) on the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B will be multidisciplinary, with members who have a range of technical knowledge, skills and experience relevant to the underlisted areas. Approximately 15 members may be selected.

Boosting efforts to transform care for severe chronic diseases in Africa,2024-04-26,"WHO/Ivan Simone Congolo Credits Boosting efforts to transform care for severe chronic diseases in Africa 26 April 2024 Dar es Salaam – Health experts from across Africa, policymakers, civil society organizations and partners meeting for the first-ever conference on strengthening efforts to address the burden of severe chronic disease have called for increased recognition of the emergency presented by noncommunicable diseases and the premature deaths they cause. The International Conference on PEN-Plus in Africa (ICPPA) meeting, held from 22 to 25 April 2024, highlighted “grossly inequitable access to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing care” and committed to advocate for increased focus on chronic and severe noncommunicable diseases (NCD) within existing health systems, and extending prevention, diagnosis, treatment and quality care to the primary health level. The meeting in Tanzania’s commercial capital Dar es Salaam called on governments to provide leadership in public health to ensure adequate and quality services, to act to reduce the known risk factors for NCDs and to increase domestic investments. The conference, which was dedicated to mainstreaming strategies to alleviate the burden of severe chronic diseases at first-level referral health facilities, highlighted the urgency of decentralizing care for type 1 diabetes, sickle cell disease, and rheumatic and congenital heart diseases, to save millions of lives over the next decade, including those of many children and young adults afflicted by these conditions. In the African region, healthcare services for severe NCDs are predominantly confined to major urban centres, leaving countless individuals without sufficient care and burdened with high financial costs. Hosted by the Government of Tanzania, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the African region and other partners including Helmsley Charitable Trust, the three-day event provided a platform for health experts, policymakers, civil society organizations, donors, private sector representatives and NCDs affected persons, survivors and community advocates to expedite political and financial backing for PEN-Plus, an innovative healthcare delivery model birthed in Africa. “We are honoured to have you all here for this critical conference at a time when hundreds of thousands of Africans of all ages suffer preventable, premature deaths from NCDs due to health inequities. This is a chance for us to unite to advance regional efforts to tackle the crisis, by investing in and scaling up PEN-Plus,” said Hon. Ummy Mwalimu, Minister of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania. Participants delved into strategies to reinforce NCD management within health systems continent-wide and sought collaborative opportunities to align PEN-Plus with other regional public health programmes. “Africa is severely affected, and in the region, more than any place in the world, NCDs are called ‘the silent epidemic’,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Africa must invest more now in addressing NCDs with adequate and sustained resources. With support from partners, we aim to strengthen the implementation of the PEN-Plus Regional Strategy, mainstream the prevention and control of chronic and severe NCDs in the region and ensure that people living with these chronic and severe conditions receive the lifesaving care they deserve.” All 47 member states of the WHO African region have endorsed the model as their official strategy for caring for individuals with severe NCDs. To date, 17 countries have initiated PEN-Plus, with 11 actively implementing the programme. The PEN-Plus strategy expands upon the WHO PEN (Package of Essential Noncommunicable disease interventions), which decentralizes care for common NCDs to primary healthcare facilities. PEN-Plus extends this care to first-level referral facilities, such as district hospitals, and has demonstrated significant success in increasing patient access to treatment for severe NCDs, improving patient outcomes. “PEN-Plus addresses a critical gap in health care for the world’s poorest billion, bringing lifesaving care for severe NCDs to first-level rural hospitals for the first time. It also bridges major gaps in health systems for training, mentorship and referral pathways,” said Dr Ana Mocumbi, co-chair of the NCDI Poverty Network. The Government of Tanzania, WHO Africa, and The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust co-sponsored the conference, with the NCDI Poverty Network serving as a technical partner. ""PEN-Plus showcases the lifesaving impact of collaborating with local health leaders and designing health systems around people,"" said Dr Gina Agiostratidou, type 1 diabetes Program Director for the Helmsley Charitable Trust. ""Now, children with noncommunicable diseases in rural areas can receive the care they need to lead full, vibrant lives. At ICPPA, we have had the opportunity to join partners in discussing how we can expand the program to reach even more communities."" The consensus among experts, leaders, and partners at the conference is clear: PEN-Plus is a reliable system with a proven track record, capable of delivering lifesaving care to those with severe NCDs in rural sub-Saharan Africa – investing in PEN-Plus represents a historic and pivotal collective action that will save and improve millions of lives, reduce healthcare costs, enhance health system capacities, boost productivity, promote equity, and contribute to achieving Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Pioneering charter to drive up investment in Africa’s health workforce,2024-04-25,"Pioneering charter to drive up investment in Africa’s health workforce 25 April 2024 Brazzaville – A pioneering health investment charter, a first for the African region, is set to be launched at the African Health Workforce Investment Forum which will take place in Windhoek, Namibia from 6 – 8 May 2024. Key stakeholders will gather to consolidate efforts to drive up investment to counter critical health worker shortages. With a bold target of halving Africa’s critical 5.3-million health workforce shortage by 2030, the African Health Workforce Investment Charter will mobilize and align domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow and retain the continent’s health workforce, especially in rural and primary health care settings. “Africa’s health worker sector is at a crossroads. The underinvestment in training and employing health workers, coupled with inadequate incentives to retain the workforce, has resulted in unfortunate levels of migration, both within and out of the continent.” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “It is time to urgently invest more and in smarter ways in our health workforce. Our future depends on it.” Addressing the gaps necessitates a continent-wide increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expenditure on health of up to 1.5%, with more than half of that dedicated to health workforce investment specifically. Despite a 13% improvement in efficiency between 2014 and 2019, African health systems remain only 77% efficient. In effect, this means that about US$1 in every US$5 spent on health is lost to technical inefficiencies, including health workforce management. This plays a significant role in the existence of ghost workers on payrolls, absenteeism and sub-optimal performance, for example. At the upcoming forum, stakeholders will discuss the progress made in health workforce strengthening over the last 10 years and hammer out the details of new strategies to, among other things, protect health workforce budgets, address recurrent costs, and bolster investments amid existing domestic and global economic challenges, and debt concerns. The forum will also engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter. Investment in the health workforce has multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, especially benefiting women and young people, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage. For every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, noting that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%. About 170 participants are expected to attend the forum, including policy makers from the health, education, labour/employment and finance sectors, along with partners from civil society financing, bilateral and multilateral institutions. Key partners supporting the forum include the ILO-OECD-WHO Working for Health (W4H) Programme and its Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF), The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Frontline Health Workers Coalition.

Major step in malaria prevention as three West African countries roll out vaccine  ,2024-04-25,"Major step in malaria prevention as three West African countries roll out vaccine 25 April 2024 Cotonou/Freetown/Monrovia — In a significant step forward for malaria prevention in Africa, three countries—Benin, Liberia and Sierra Leone—today launched a large-scale rollout of the life-saving malaria vaccine targeting millions of children across the three West African nations. The vaccine rollout, announced on World Malaria Day, seeks to further scale up vaccine deployment in the African region. Today’s launch brings to eight the number of countries on the continent to offer the malaria vaccine as part of the childhood immunization programmes, extending access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Several of the more than 30 countries in the African region that have expressed interest in the vaccine are scheduled to roll it out in the next year through support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as efforts continue to widen its deployment in the region in coordination with other prevention measures such as long-lasting insecticidal nets and seasonal malaria chemoprevention. Benin, which received 215 900 doses, has added the malaria vaccine to its Expanded Programme on Immunization. The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from around 5 months of age. “The introduction of the malaria vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunization for our children is a major step forward in the fight against this scourge. I would like to reassure that the malaria vaccines are safe and effective and contribute to the protection of our children against this serious and fatal diseases,” said Prof Benjamin Hounkpatin, Minister of Health of Benin. In Liberia, the vaccine was launched in the southern Rivercess County and will be rolled out afterwards in five other counties which have high malaria burden. At least 45 000 children are expected to benefit from the 112 000 doses of the available vaccine. ""For far too long, malaria has stolen the laughter and dreams of our children. But today, with this vaccine and the unwavering commitment of our communities, healthcare workers and our partners, including GAVI, UNICEF and WHO, we break the chain. We have a powerful tool that will protect them from this devastating illness and related deaths, ensuring their right to health and a brighter future. Let's end malaria in Liberia and pave the way for a healthier, more just society,"" said Dr Louise Kpoto, Liberia’s Minister of Health. Two safe and effective vaccines — RTS,S and R21 — recommended by World Health Organization (WHO), are a breakthrough for child health and malaria control. A pilot malaria vaccine programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi reached over 2 million children from 2019 to 2023, showing a significant reduction in malaria illness and a 13% drop in overall child mortality and substantial reductions in hospitalizations. In Sierra Leone, the first doses were administered to children at a health centre in Western Area Rural where the authorities kicked off the rollout of 550 000 vaccine doses. The vaccine will then be delivered in health facilities nationwide. “With the new, safe and efficacious malaria vaccine, we now have an additional tool to fight this disease. In combination with insecticide-treated nets, effective diagnosis and treatment, and indoor spraying, no child should die from malaria infection,” said Dr Austin Demby, Minister of Health of Sierra Leone. Malaria remains a huge health challenge in the African region, which is home to 11 countries that carry approximately 70% of the global burden of malaria. The region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of all malaria deaths in 2022, according to the World Malaria Report 2023. “The African region is advancing in the rollout of the malaria vaccine – a game-changer in our fight against this deadly disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Working with our member states and partners, we’re supporting the ongoing efforts to save the lives of young children and lower the malaria burden in the region.” Aurelia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, noted: “Today we celebrate more children gaining access to a new lifesaving tool to fight one of Africa’s deadliest diseases. This introduction of malaria vaccines into routine programmes in Benin, Liberia, and Sierra Leone alongside other proven interventions will help save lives and offer relief to families, communities and hard-pressed health systems.” Progress against malaria has stalled in these high-burden African countries since 2017 due to factors including climate change, humanitarian crises, low access to and insufficient quality of health services, gender-related barriers, biological threats such as insecticide and drug resistance and global economic crises. Fragile health systems and critical gaps in data and surveillance have compounded the challenge. To put malaria progress back on track, WHO recommends robust commitment to malaria responses at all levels, particularly in high-burden countries; greater domestic and international funding; science and data-driven malaria responses; urgent action on the health impacts of climate change; harnessing research and innovation; as well as strong partnerships for coordinated responses. WHO is also calling attention to addressing delays in malaria programme implementation.

Over 50 million lives saved in Africa through expanded immunization programme,2024-04-24,"Over 50 million lives saved in Africa through expanded immunization programme 24 April 2024 Brazzaville—An estimated 51.2 million lives have been saved through vaccines in the African region over the past 50 years. For every infant life saved over that period, close to 60 years of life are lived, a new report by World Health Organization (WHO) finds. These achievements have been possible under the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), a WHO initiative launched in 1974 as a global endeavour to ensure equitable access to life-saving vaccines for every child, regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic status. The report, which assesses the life-saving impact of vaccines, was released today at the start of this year’s African Vaccination Week and World Immunization Week being marked from 24–30 April under the theme “Safeguarding Our Future: Humanly Possible”. With the continuous support from WHO, UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and many others, today most countries in the region provide antigens for 13 vaccine-preventable diseases, up from the initial six when the EPI was introduced. Notable achievements have been made, including reduction in measles deaths, with an estimated 19.5 million deaths averted over the last 22 years. The region has also witnessed a sharp decline in meningitis deaths by up to 39% in 2019 compared with 2000. Maternal and neonatal tetanus has nearly been eliminated in the region, and in a historic public health achievement, the African region was declared free of indigenous wild poliovirus in 2022 following years of relentless work to protect every child from the virus. “From disease prevention to eradication the success story of vaccines is a compelling one. Millions of people are alive and healthy today thanks to the protection vaccines offer,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “We have half a century of momentum and have accomplished so much. Now we must sustain and expand vaccine equity to end the threat of vaccine-preventable diseases.” The rollout of new vaccines such as the first ever malaria vaccine, and expansion of existing vaccines, such as for HPV, which protects against the leading cause of cervical cancer, has also set up future generations in Africa with an opportunity to thrive. “Today we celebrate the monumental advances governments and partners have taken across Africa in the last fifty years to ensure so many more children on the continent are living past their fifth birthday thanks to vaccination,” said UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Etleva Khadilli. “Leaders, partners and donors must strive to protect immunization gains in the region especially in the face of backsliding rates in recent years.” “Children that are not, or not enough, vaccinated often come from communities missed across the spectrum of social services. We must focus our efforts on finding them and ensuring they receive the life-saving vaccines and other services they need. Together, with leaders and communities, we can make this a reality,” said Gilles Fagninou, the UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa. Through Gavi, an alliance of immunization partners including WHO and UNICEF established in 2000 to expand the impact of the EPI, countries are supported to deliver vaccines against vaccine-preventable diseases including others such as cervical cancer and malaria, and to respond to outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola and cholera. “The evidence is clear: vaccines are one of the most impactful and cost-effective investments in health and development in history. Over the past two decades, Gavi has worked with 40 African countries to expand immunisation coverage while delivering new innovations like the HPV and malaria vaccines and responding to deadly outbreaks – saving millions of lives and generating billions in economic benefits,” said Thabani Maphosa, Managing Director of Country Programmes Delivery at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “With climate change, crises and the threat of infectious disease on the rise it is more important than ever that governments invest in immunisation to help ensure everyone, everywhere has an equal opportunity for a safe and healthy future.” While progress in vaccine coverage has been made, the region still faces challenges in achieving and sustaining high immunization coverage rates for most of the vaccine-preventable diseases. There are also challenges in ensuring equitable vaccine access across the continent with a significant number of children yet to receive a single dose of life-saving vaccines while others not receiving enough doses. In addition, the disruptive impact of COVID-19 further strained immunization efforts. The region is yet to fully recover from the pandemic’s disruptions to immunization. In 2022, coverage for the first and third doses of the diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1 and DTP3, respectively) and the first dose of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in the region was estimated at 80%, 72% and 69%, respectively (all below the 2019 level). Only 13 of the 47 countries in the region achieved the global target coverage of 90% or above with DTP3 in 2022. Efforts to address gaps in immunization coverage have been intensified through the “Big Catch-Up” initiative that aims to reach children who have been underserved or missed by routine vaccination programmes. Innovative initiatives such as the Zero-dose Immunization Programme have also been established to reach communities that are living in conflict and fragile areas with essential health services. Further efforts are needed to accelerate progress to meet the goals of Immunization Agenda 2030, a strategy endorsed during the WHO World Health Assembly in 2020, which seeks to reduce mortality and morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases, ensure equitable access to vaccines and strengthen immunization within primary health care. A regional framework to implement the Immunization Agenda has been adopted. To sustain progress key strategies need to be implemented. These include controlling protracted and frequent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases; increasing investment in health systems and infrastructure for effective vaccine delivery; enhancing surveillance systems to respond swiftly to outbreaks; addressing vaccine hesitancy and misinformation; bolstering domestic funding for immunization programmes; increasing the use of innovation and technology for better vaccine delivery; and investing in research and development for vaccine development.

Eritrea Observed World TB Day 2024,2024-03-28,"Eritrea Observed World TB Day 2024 28 March 2024 World TB Day was commemorated on 24 March 2024 at Orotta Conference Hall in Asmara, capital city of Eritrea. This year’s theme is “Yes, we can end TB,” highlighting the need to ensure equitable access to prevention and care, in line with our drive towards the elimination of TB disease. During the event, the National TB Program Manager in the Ministry of Health, Sr. Hiwet Negusse stated that tangible progress has been registered in declining new infections and deaths due to TB and added that the disease is preventable taking the right measures. At the end, Sr Hiwet appreciated the whole organizing committee and thanked all stakeholders, including the two mothers who shared their TB survivor stories. On behalf of WHO Regional Director (RD) for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti and representing WHO Eritrea, Dr Nonso, OIC read RD’s message, noting that the 72nd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa in Lomé, Togo, in 2022 ignited a powerful movement toward ending tuberculosis (TB) - that of prioritizing childhood TB and sharing that since then, a 20% increase has been recorded in identified pediatric TB cases compared to the previous year. The speech further highlighted significant milestone achievements in the fight against TB such as diagnosing 70% of TB patients reducing missed cases, 38% reduction in TB deaths and 23% reduction in new TB cases between 2015 and 2022 all attributed to the relentless efforts of our Member States and partners It further noted that, while the reduction in TB deaths is commendable, it still falls short of the 2025 EndTB Strategy target of a 75% reduction in TB deaths and 50% reduction in incidences and this highlights the need for continued and intensified efforts to meet these ambitious goals. The RD in her speech urged all our Member States to prioritize a multi-faceted approach that addresses the root causes of the disease while bolstering our efforts in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and urged health leaders to intensify their commitment to strengthening health systems, ensuring equitable access to TB care and scaling up innovative interventions. She further emphasized that investing in research and developing new tools, including vaccines and improved diagnostics, is essential to accelerate progress. Attention was also drawn to the social determinants of TB, such as poverty, inequality, and limited access to healthcare, stating the need for collaboration across sectors and borders. In conclusion she firmly committed to supporting all our Member States and partners with unwavering determination for a world free of TB. This day was commemorated in the presence of higher officials from Ministry of Health, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Education, WHO, National Union of Eritrean Women, National Union of Eritrean Youth and Students, Health professionals, Students, and the media. Winners of the contest held to mark the commemoration, who made presentations and read poems were awarded with prizes. Other highlights of the day were cultural shows, dramas songs and poems for increasing awareness on TB."

African island states take fresh step towards joint medicines procurement ,2024-03-27,"African island states take fresh step towards joint medicines procurement 27 March 2024 Victoria ‒ In a further move towards pooled procurement of essential medicines and medical products, Ministers of Health from small African islands states established a secretariat and elected Mauritius as the host, taking critical steps to launch joint operations for increased access to affordable, quality-assured and safe medicines and medical supplies. The pooled procurement programme, signed in 2020 by Cabo Verde, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritius, Sao Tome & Principe and Seychelles, that form the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from Africa, and endorsed by Madagascar, aims to coordinate the purchase of selected medicines and medical products affordably, harmonize medicines management systems, improve supplier performance and reduce procurement workload. The programme also sets the guiding principles and governance structure, including the creation of a secretariat, technical committees and a council of ministers. The ministers, gathering for the 8th SIDS meeting in Victoria, Seychelles, took the new step to set up a secretariat as they embark on the final stages of the joint procurement initiative. “Mauritius is honoured to assume this important responsibility and we thank fellow SIDS countries and Madagascar for the confidence demonstrated in us to host the pooled drugs procurement secretariat,” said Hon Kailesh Jagutpal, Minister of Health and Wellness of Mauritius. “We will assume this duty with the care and rigour that it requires for the common good of all people and countries represented.” Pooled procurement has been on the SIDS agenda since 2017 when the countries expressed commitment to implement the initiative. “I congratulate Mauritius on the election as host for the secretariat. This is a win for all of us. Our unique position of SIDS in the African region is what brings us together and makes us stronger,” said Cabo Verde Minister of Health, Hon Filomena Gonçalves. “We will continue to play an important role in moving the agenda of pooled procurement forward and will work closely with our partners, including WHO.” During the 25–27 March 2024 meeting, the ministers and government representatives also agreed to strengthen collective efforts and actions on health, including bolstering preparedness and response to health emergencies, strengthening health systems and putting in place measures to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, to which island nations are particularly vulnerable. “As a collective we have come together to explore different ways of working so we can make our voices heard in all the important global arenas. Even if we don’t always have the capacity on our own, through SIDS we can do it. We may be small, but we can be big in our actions,” said Hon Peggy Vidot, Minister of Health of the Seychelles. The meeting was the first for Guinea-Bissau, which has now become a full member of SIDS, and for Madagascar, which accepted the invitation to be part of the SIDS Network initiative and therefore part of pooled procurement efforts. “This meeting will be remembered as a milestone. We’ve had fruitful discussions and made important decisions that will have an impact on SIDS and the rest of the region. At WHO, we will provide technical support to SIDS to ensure the implementation of the agreed-upon actions from this meeting,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa. The SIDS meeting in the African region serves as a forum for a collective voice for joint inputs into global SIDS events, including the upcoming Fourth International Conference on SIDS in Antigua and Barbuda, which will take place in late May 2024.

The ministers, gathering for the 8th SIDS meeting in Victoria, Seychelles, took the new step to set up a secretariat as they embark on the final stages of the joint procurement initiative. “Mauritius is honoured to assume this important responsibility and we thank fellow SIDS countries and Madagascar for the confidence demonstrated in us to host the pooled drugs procurement secretariat,” said Hon Kailesh Jagutpal, Minister of Health and Wellness of Mauritius. “We will assume this duty with the care and rigour that it requires for the common good of all people and countries represented.” Pooled procurement has been on the SIDS agenda since 2017 when the countries expressed commitment to implement the initiative. “I congratulate Mauritius on the election as host for the secretariat. This is a win for all of us. Our unique position of SIDS in the African region is what brings us together and makes us stronger,” said Cabo Verde Minister of Health, Hon Filomena Gonçalves. “We will continue to play an important role in moving the agenda of pooled procurement forward and will work closely with our partners, including WHO.” During the 25–27 March 2024 meeting, the ministers and government representatives also agreed to strengthen collective efforts and actions on health, including bolstering preparedness and response to health emergencies, strengthening health systems and putting in place measures to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, to which island nations are particularly vulnerable. “As a collective we have come together to explore different ways of working so we can make our voices heard in all the important global arenas. Even if we don’t always have the capacity on our own, through SIDS we can do it. We may be small, but we can be big in our actions,” said Hon Peggy Vidot, Minister of Health of the Seychelles. The meeting was the first for Guinea-Bissau, which has now become a full member of SIDS, and for Madagascar, which accepted the invitation to be part of the SIDS Network initiative and therefore part of pooled procurement efforts. “This meeting will be remembered as a milestone. We’ve had fruitful discussions and made important decisions that will have an impact on SIDS and the rest of the region. At WHO, we will provide technical support to SIDS to ensure the implementation of the agreed-upon actions from this meeting,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa. The SIDS meeting in the African region serves as a forum for a collective voice for joint inputs into global SIDS events, including the upcoming Fourth International Conference on SIDS in Antigua and Barbuda, which will take place in late May 2024.

"Liberias World Health Day Commemoration Activities Unveiled: ""My Health, My Right"" i...",2024-03-23,"Liberias World Health Day Commemoration Activities Unveiled: ""My Health, My Right"" in perspective 23 March 2024 Monrovia - Climaxing the year-long celebration marking 75 years of the World Health Organization's (WHO) existence, World Health Day on April 7th this year serves as the conclusion of this significant milestone. While last year's observance celebrated WHO's achievements on the journey to achieving Health For All, this year's commemoration takes on a broader perspective by highlighting health as a fundamental human right under the theme ""My Health, My Right."" In a media briefing held at the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Clement Peter, the WHO Representative for Liberia, unveiled a comprehensive series of activities lined up in preparation for the upcoming commemoration of World Health Day 2024, slated for April 8th. The scheduled events organized by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO are geared towards advocating for health equity and access to essential healthcare services across Liberia. Dr. Peter emphasized the significance of empowering individuals to assert their right to health, stressing that health is not merely the absence of disease but an absolute right for every individual, to be accessed whenever and wherever needed. He reiterated the core principles of inclusivity and advocacy for health rights, which lie at the heart of this year's commemoration. Aligned with the theme, a series of activities have been planned to resonate with the principles of health equity and inclusivity. One of the events is a vaccination drive for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) at a school in Monrovia. This is in recognition of the global burden of cervical cancer among women. Liberia has committed to a global strategy to combat this disease. Dr. Peter emphasized the importance of HPV vaccination for adolescent girls, aiming for 90% coverage by 2030. ""There is a global strategy Liberia is party to in order to defeat cervical cancer by 2030, which is to ensure 90% of eligible adolescent girls receive the HPV vaccine; 70% of women access treatment for cervical cancer and 90% of women access screening services for cervical cancer. The young girls need information on where to get the vaccines, they need information on the importance of the vaccine, they need information on our solidarity to get rid of cervical cancer in Liberia. As such, this event is a demonstration of Liberia's commitment to protect young girls and provide them with essential information about the vaccine and cervical cancer prevention,"" said Dr. Peter. Dr. Peter also disclosed two blood donation drives to be organized, one at the Ministry of Health and another at the United Nations compound, to promote voluntary blood donation and the availability of blood when needed. The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with WHO, is intensifying efforts to strengthen the blood program in Liberia. He also referenced the unfortunate Totota tanker explosion last year, which highlighted the critical need for blood and oxygen in emergencies to save lives. As a symbol of inclusivity and solidarity with the disabled community, wheelchairs will be donated to demonstrate that disability does not equate to inability. This initiative underscores the importance of inclusivity in healthcare and highlights the collective contribution of all members of society towards a healthier Liberia. In closing, Dr. Peter emphasized that these activities serve to underscore the fundamental right to health enshrined in legal instruments such as the WHO's constitution, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Liberia's constitution. He called upon all stakeholders to prioritize health at the center of development efforts, ensuring better health and well-being for all Liberians. The commemoration of World Health Day 2024 promises to be a meaningful, uniting communities in advocacy for health rights and reaffirming the commitment to leave no one behind in the journey towards universal health coverage.

"Rate of TB diagnosis, treatment in Africa increasing",2024-03-23,"WHO / Lindsay Mackenzie Credits Rate of TB diagnosis, treatment in Africa increasing 23 March 2024 Brazzaville – About 70% of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the African region are now being diagnosed and treated, marking the highest case-detection rate in the region ever, thanks to concerted efforts by countries to address the threat of the disease. Although the case detection rate has been on the rise since 2018, the region saw a significant increase between 2020 and 2022, rising from 60% to 70% of cases being detected, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Tuberculosis Report 2023. There has also been a notable reduction in the region in the number of people with TB who miss diagnosis. An estimated 700 000 people missed diagnosis in 2022, a 10% reduction compared with 2021. To further rally efforts to end the disease through concerted global efforts to advance detection, diagnosis and treatment, World TB Day is being marked this year under the theme “Yes! We can end TB”. In the African region a range of factors have helped boost TB diagnosis rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries-maintained TB notification services, ensuring that cases were detected and treated. In Nigeria, which has a huge TB burden, case notification nearly tripled over the past five years to 285 000 cases in 2022 from 106 000 cases in 2018. Improvement in the management of HIV infection, a significant driver of TB, has also bolstered TB detection rates in the region. “More efforts are still needed to reduce the devastating impacts of this disease on families and communities. As WHO we continue working closely with governments to address the barriers to effective response and speed up the momentum to make TB history,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. The region, which accounts of 23% of TB cases and 33% of deaths globally, is making steady progress towards ending the disease. For example, Cabo Verde, Eswatini and South Africa have achieved at least a 50% reduction in TB cases. The WHO End TB Strategy calls for countries to reduce TB deaths by 75% and cases by 50% by 2025 compared with the 2015 levels. Across the region TB deaths fell by 38% and new cases declined by 23% in 2022 compared with 2015. High-burden TB countries have surpassed the 2025 milestone to lower TB deaths. Despite the progress, further efforts are needed to meet the 2030 global End TB Strategy targets to cut TB deaths by 90% and cases by 80%. These include increased investments in TB control programmes. In 2022, in the African Region, the Global Plan to End TB 2018-2022 estimated that US$ 3.9 billion were required annually to achieve the targets, but only around US$ 890 million were mobilized for TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Domestic funding represented about 46% of total funding for TB (54% from international funding) in 2022. Limited access to health services, inadequate health infrastructure, insufficient quality of care, inadequate human resources for health and inadequate social protection are also impeding progress to ending TB. Globally TB continues to claim millions of lives annually. In the African region Africa, TB was the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, with nearly 2.5 million people falling ill and 424 000 lives lost in 2022.

African health ministers commit to end malaria deaths,2024-03-06,"African health ministers commit to end malaria deaths 06 March 2024 Yaoundé — Ministers of Health from African countries with the highest burden of malaria committed today to accelerated action to end deaths from the disease. They pledged to sustainably and equitably address the threat of malaria in the African region, which accounts for 95% of malaria deaths globally. The Ministers, gathering in Yaoundé, Cameroon, signed a declaration committing to provide stronger leadership and increased domestic funding for malaria control programmes; to ensure further investment in data technology; to apply the latest technical guidance in malaria control and elimination; and to enhance malaria control efforts at the national and sub-national levels. The Ministers further pledged to increase health sector investments to bolster infrastructure, personnel and programme implementation; to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration; and to build partnerships for funding, research and innovation. In signing the declaration, they expressed their “unwavering commitment to the accelerated reduction of malaria mortality” and “to hold each other and our countries accountable for the commitments outlined in this declaration.” The Yaoundé conference, co-hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Government of Cameroon, gathered Ministers of Health, global malaria partners, funding agencies, scientists, civil society organizations and other principal malaria stakeholders. The ministerial conference has four key aims: review progress and challenges in achieving the targets of the WHO global malaria strategy; discuss mitigation strategies and funding for malaria; agree on effective strategies and responses for accelerated malaria mortality reduction in Africa; and establish a roadmap for increased political commitment and societal engagement in malaria control, with a clear accountability mechanism. “This declaration reflects our shared commitment as nations and partners to protect our people from the devastating consequences of malaria. We will work together to ensure that this commitment is translated into action and impact,” said Hon Manaouda Malachie, Minister for Health of Cameroon. The African region is home to 11 countries that carry approximately 70% of the global burden of malaria: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, NIgeria, Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania. Progress against malaria has stalled in these high-burden African countries since 2017 due to factors including humanitarian crises, low access to and insufficient quality of health services, climate change, gender-related barriers, biological threats such as insecticide and drug resistance and global economic crises. Fragile health systems and critical gaps in data and surveillance have compounded the challenge. Funding for malaria control globally is also inadequate. In 2022, US$ 4.1 billion – just over half of the needed budget – was available for malaria response. Globally the number of cases in 2022 was significantly higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic, rising to 249 million from 233 million in 2019. In the same period, the African region saw an increase in cases from 218 million to 233 million. The region continues to shoulder the heaviest malaria burden, representing 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of global deaths, an estimated 580 000 deaths in 2022. “Globally, the world has made significant progress against malaria in recent decades and yet, since 2017, that progress has stalled,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The COVID-19 pandemic and long-standing threats like drug and insecticide resistance pushed us further off-track, with critical gaps in funding and access to tools to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria. With political leadership, country ownership and the commitment of a broad coalition of partners, we can change this story for families and communities across Africa.” To help accelerate efforts to reduce the malaria burden, WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria launched the “High burden to high impact” approach in 2018, a targeted effort to accelerate progress in countries hardest hit by malaria. The declaration signed at today’s conference is aligned with the “High burden to high impact” approach, which is founded on four pillars: political will to reduce malaria deaths; strategic information to drive impact; better guidance, policies and strategies; and a coordinated national malaria response. “Malaria continues to cause preventable deaths in children and great devastation to families across our region. We welcome today’s ministerial declaration, which demonstrates a strong political will to reduce the burden of this deadly disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “With renewed urgency and commitment, we can accelerate progress towards a future free of malaria.” To put malaria progress back on track, WHO recommends robust commitment to malaria responses at all levels, particularly in high-burden countries; greater domestic and international funding; science and data-driven malaria responses; urgent action on the health impacts of climate change; harnessing research and innovation; as well as strong partnerships for coordinated responses. WHO is also calling attention to the need to address delays in malaria programme implementation.

"WHO Africa, UNICEF and Partners poised to advance implementation of Baby-Friendly Ho...",2024-02-19,"WHO Africa, UNICEF and Partners poised to advance implementation of Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative in countries 19 February 2024 Nairobi - In a concerted effort to strengthen maternal and child health services across Africa, the World Health Organization, in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), convened a capacity-building workshop targeting healthcare professionals, policymakers, and stakeholders from ten countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). The workshop, held from 12 to 15 February 2024 in Nairobi, Kenya, focused on enhancing countries' capabilities to effectively implement the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) as an integral component of maternal and newborn health quality care strategies. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), aims to protect and support breastfeeding and mother-baby bonding by ensuring that maternity facilities adhere to the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. According to global evidence, implementing the BFHI significantly improves breastfeeding rates and better child health outcomes. For one thing, early initiation of breastfeeding has proven to reduce the risk of infant mortality and important in driving progress against global nutrition targets – against stunting, anaemia in women of reproductive age, low birth weight, childhood overweight and wasting. However, BFHI implementation is still below standard. In the African region, only 2 out of 42 countries have more than 50% of births in Baby-friendly facilities. This coupled with the plunging breastfeeding rates worldwide driven by aggressive marketing of infant formula to mothers. It is against this backdrop that WHO and partners met in Kenya to accelerate countries' commitment and action to adapting and institutionalizing the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding within national standards of care, strengthening country-led, comprehensive approaches to increased access to skilled breastfeeding counselling. ""This capacity-building workshop represents a significant milestone in our collective efforts to advance maternal and child health outcomes in Africa,” says Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO representative from Kenya. He added that by strengthening healthcare professionals' capacity to promote breastfeeding and implement BFHI, WHO and Partners are laying a solid foundation for improving newborn survival, reducing childhood morbidity and mortality, and achieving sustainable development goals."" Key highlights from the capacity building workshop include plenary discussions featuring insights from policymakers on overcoming barriers and sustaining momentum in BFHI implementation. Countries enhanced their understanding of the ten steps to successful breastfeeding in health facilities providing maternity and newborn services and its integration into the health system as part of the quality of care. The workshop also provided a platform for participants to exchange experiences, share best practices, and forge partnerships for collective action in advancing BFHI implementation across WHO AFRO countries. Christiane Rudert, the Regional Advisor for UNICEF Eastern and Southern Africa, asserts that such capacity-building workshops play a crucial role in equipping healthcare practitioners and other stakeholders with the necessary tools to offer essential support to infants and mothers, particularly from vulnerable communities. “Breastfeeding makes a world of difference to both mother and child. From birth to 6 months of age, feeding infants nothing but breastmilk guarantees them a food source that is uniquely adapted to their nutrient needs, while also being safe, clean, healthy and accessible, no matter where they live. Breastfeeding provides essential benefits, including protection against infections, optimal growth, and emotional closeness between mother and baby. It’s a precious gift that contributes to the health and well-being of both infants and mothers. In the end the participating Countries developed action plans and took bold commitments to drive BFHI implementation at the national and subnational levels, with a focus on monitoring and evaluation to track progress and impact. Speaking on behalf of the Ugandan team at the workshop, Laura Ahumuza Senior Nutritionist and coordinator of Maternal, Infant and Young child and Adolescent nutrition, MoH says Uganda is hoping to strengthen integration of BFHI implementation within the health sector with close collaboration with other sector. This includes - nursing, midwifery, reproductive health, nutrition, and related sectors. Meanwhile Olivia Timpo, from Ghana, stated that Ghana plans to embrace new approaches and verify health worker competences for knowledge and skill in handling and sustaining breastfeeding. ” We also want to engage stakeholders and use facilitation of processes to inspire quality and breastfeeding indicators.” WHO and UNICEF launched the BFHI more than three decades ago to motivate managers and staff working in health facilities to provide maternity and newborn services through the implementation of the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. Over the years, WHO has revised the BFHI guideline to include relevant aspects of the International Code for Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes. The strategy also encapsulates key policies and procedures to be implemented in hospitals to promote and support breastfeeding. Through such capacity strengthening workshop, WHO AFRO reaffirms its commitment to providing ongoing support, technical assistance, and resources to facilitate the effective implementation of BFHI across the region.

"WHO Africa, UNICEF and Partners poised to advance implementation of Baby-Friendly Ho...",2024-02-19,"WHO Africa, UNICEF and Partners poised to advance implementation of Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative in countries 19 February 2024 Nairobi - In a concerted effort to strengthen maternal and child health services across Africa, the World Health Organization, in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), convened a capacity-building workshop targeting healthcare professionals, policymakers, and stakeholders from ten countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). The workshop, held from 12 to 15 February 2024 in Nairobi, Kenya, focused on enhancing countries' capabilities to effectively implement the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) as an integral component of maternal and newborn health quality care strategies. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), aims to protect and support breastfeeding and mother-baby bonding by ensuring that maternity facilities adhere to the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. According to global evidence, implementing the BFHI significantly improves breastfeeding rates and better child health outcomes. For one thing, early initiation of breastfeeding has proven to reduce the risk of infant mortality and important in driving progress against global nutrition targets – against stunting, anaemia in women of reproductive age, low birth weight, childhood overweight and wasting. However, BFHI implementation is still below standard. In the African region, only 2 out of 42 countries have more than 50% of births in Baby-friendly facilities. This coupled with the plunging breastfeeding rates worldwide driven by aggressive marketing of infant formula to mothers. It is against this backdrop that WHO and partners met in Kenya to accelerate countries' commitment and action to adapting and institutionalizing the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding within national standards of care, strengthening country-led, comprehensive approaches to increased access to skilled breastfeeding counselling. ""This capacity-building workshop represents a significant milestone in our collective efforts to advance maternal and child health outcomes in Africa,” says Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO representative from Kenya. He added that by strengthening healthcare professionals' capacity to promote breastfeeding and implement BFHI, WHO and Partners are laying a solid foundation for improving newborn survival, reducing childhood morbidity and mortality, and achieving sustainable development goals."" Key highlights from the capacity building workshop include plenary discussions featuring insights from policymakers on overcoming barriers and sustaining momentum in BFHI implementation. Countries enhanced their understanding of the ten steps to successful breastfeeding in health facilities providing maternity and newborn services and its integration into the health system as part of the quality of care. The workshop also provided a platform for participants to exchange experiences, share best practices, and forge partnerships for collective action in advancing BFHI implementation across WHO AFRO countries. Christiane Rudert, the Regional Advisor for UNICEF Eastern and Southern Africa, asserts that such capacity-building workshops play a crucial role in equipping healthcare practitioners and other stakeholders with the necessary tools to offer essential support to infants and mothers, particularly from vulnerable communities. “Breastfeeding makes a world of difference to both mother and child. From birth to 6 months of age, feeding infants nothing but breastmilk guarantees them a food source that is uniquely adapted to their nutrient needs, while also being safe, clean, healthy and accessible, no matter where they live. Breastfeeding provides essential benefits, including protection against infections, optimal growth, and emotional closeness between mother and baby. It’s a precious gift that contributes to the health and well-being of both infants and mothers. In the end the participating Countries developed action plans and took bold commitments to drive BFHI implementation at the national and subnational levels, with a focus on monitoring and evaluation to track progress and impact.

Nearly 10 000 children vaccinated as malaria vaccine rollout in Africa expands,2024-02-09,"Nearly 10 000 children vaccinated as malaria vaccine rollout in Africa expands 09 February 2024 Brazzaville – Nearly 10 000 children in Burkina Faso and Cameroon have now received the RTS,S malaria vaccine since being introduced this year. A wider malaria vaccine rollout is underway this year in several African countries, with Cameroon being the first outside the malaria vaccine pilot programme to do so. Cameroon launched the vaccine on 22 January 2024. It is being integrated into its national routine immunization programme in more than 500 public and private health facilities across 42 health districts in the country’s 10 regions. Burkina Faso introduced the vaccine on 5 February, becoming the latest country in the region to kick off the immunization. The game-changing vaccine complements the existing range of malaria control measures to prevent the disease and lower its burden. “Malaria is one of the major health challenges our region faces. The wider rollout of the malaria vaccine marks a significant milestone in advancing the fight against this deadly disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. “We’re committed to supporting countries to ensure that all eligible children are protected from the devastating impacts of this preventable illness.” The vaccine rollout in the two countries mark the start of a major initiative by the WHO Regional Office for Africa’s Accelerated Malaria Vaccines Introduction and Rollout in Africa (AMVIRA). AMVIRA was developed as a response to the planned introduction of the two malaria vaccines (RTS,S and R21) into the routine immunization schedules of 19 countries[1] the Africa region in 2024. Through AMVIRA, WHO in Africa will strengthen the provision of state-of-the-art support to countries in their efforts to effectively and efficiently introduce and rollout malaria vaccines. The initiative also enhances coordination with partners, UNICEF, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partners. In support of countries to ensure smooth introduction, community understanding and acceptance, and strengthened logistics, WHO has deployed 69 experts in immunization, data science and communication, across all 10 regions in Cameroon, as well as in Burkina Faso. WHO is working with countries to set up comprehensive preparations such as national vaccination policy and guidelines, integrating the new vaccine into the delivery schedule of other vaccines and health interventions, developing an operational roll out plan, training of healthcare workers, investing in infrastructure, technical capacity, vaccine storage, community engagement and demand generation, and ensuring formative supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the process to ensure quality vaccine delivery. As the malaria vaccine rollout extends to all eligible countries, WHO will continue to ensure that experts are deployed where needed, implement robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track progress, identify challenges and facilitate timely interventions where required. The effective strategies that were witnessed in Cameroon and Burkina Faso are being documented and will be shared with other countries as they prepare for and launch the vaccines. Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of related deaths in 2022. There were 249 million malaria cases globally in 2022, leading to 608 000 deaths. Of these deaths, 77% were children under 5 years of age, mostly in Africa.

Cameroon kicks off malaria vaccine rollout,2024-01-22,"Cameroon kicks off malaria vaccine rollout 22 January 2024 Yaoundé – Cameroon today launched the RTS,S malaria vaccine into its routine national immunization services, becoming the first country to do so outside the malaria vaccine pilot programme that was carried out in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. The introduction comes as efforts gather pace to scale up vaccination against the disease in high risk areas in Africa. The vaccine is being rolled out across 42 health districts in the country’s 10 regions in public and private health facilities. The launch comes after Cameroon received 331 200 doses of the vaccine in November 2023. More doses are expected in coming weeks. “The vaccine is an additional tool for malaria control. It has been chosen by the country based on its pre-qualification, ensuring guaranteed quality, efficacy and safety for inclusion in the vaccination programme,” said Dr Shalom Ndoula, Permanent Secretary of the Expanded Programme on Immunization in Cameroon. “It will specifically target all children aged six months as of 31 December 2023.” In preparation for the launch, World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the Clinton Health Access Initiative supported the national health authorities to strengthen key vaccine introduction measures. For an effective vaccine introduction, it is essential that countries put in place comprehensive preparations that include adopting the national vaccination policy and guidelines, integrating the new vaccine into the delivery schedule of other vaccines and health interventions, developing an operational roll out plan, training of healthcare workers, investing in infrastructure, technical capacity, vaccine storage, community engagement and demand generation, and ensuring formative supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the process to ensure quality vaccine delivery. “The launch of the malaria vaccine marks a significant step in the prevention and control of the disease, especially in protecting children against severe disease and death,” said Dr Phanuel Habimana, WHO Representative in Cameroon. “We’re committed to supporting the national health authorities to ensure an effective rollout of the malaria vaccine together with scale up of other malaria control measures.” Cameroon is among the 11 countries most affected by the disease globally. The country recorded more than 3 million cases and over 3800 deaths in 2021. Cameroon has made the fight against malaria one of the priorities of its National Health Development Plan. With the support of partners, malaria control and prevention efforts over the years have helped to progressively lower the burden of the disease in the country. “I chose to vaccinate my twins because I've seen how harmful malaria can be,” said Helene, whose twin children were the first to receive the malaria vaccine. “I'm committed to ensuring that my children get all the four doses of the vaccine and I'll take other steps like making sure they sleep under mosquito nets.” Since 2019, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi have been administering the RTS,S vaccine in a four-dose schedule to children from around 5 months of age in selected districts as part of the pilot programme, known as the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP). More than 2 million children have been reached with the malaria vaccine in the three African countries through MVIP with over 8 million doses administered – resulting in a remarkable 13% drop in all-cause mortality in children age-eligible to receive the vaccine, and substantial reductions in severe malaria illness and hospitalizations. Nine African countries are poised to launch the malaria vaccine this year. In addition to Cameroon, Benin, Burkina Faso and Liberia have received the vaccine and are finalizing vaccine rollout plans. WHO, Gavi, UNICEF and other partners are working closely with the African countries that are introducing the malaria vaccine to ensure delivery and successful rollout of the malaria vaccine. Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of related deaths in 2022.

"WHO Certifies Cabo Verde as Malaria-Free, Marking a Historic Milestone in the Fight ...",2024-01-12,"WHO Certifies Cabo Verde as Malaria-Free, Marking a Historic Milestone in the Fight Against Malaria 12 January 2024 A total of 43 countries and 1 territory have now been certified as malaria-free Cabo Verde – The World Health Organization (WHO) has certified Cabo Verde as a malaria-free country, marking a significant achievement in global health. With this announcement, Cabo Verde joins the ranks of 43 countries and 1 territory that WHO has awarded this certification. Cabo Verde is the third country to be certified in the WHO African region, joining Mauritius and Algeria which were certified in 1973 and 2019 respectively. Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 95% of global malaria cases and 96% of related deaths in 2021. Certification of malaria elimination will drive positive development on many fronts for Cabo Verde. Systems and structures built for malaria elimination have strengthened the health system and will be used to fight other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever. Travellers from non-malaria endemic regions can now travel to the islands of Cabo Verde without fear of local malaria infections and the potential inconvenience of preventive treatment measures. This has the potential to attract more visitors and boost socio-economic activities in a country where tourism accounts for approximately 25 per cent of GDP. Frequently asked questionsCertification of Cabo Verde as eliminating malaria “I salute the government and people of Cabo Verde for their unwavering commitment and resilience in their journey to eliminating malaria,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO’s certification of Cabo Verde being malaria-free is testament to the power of strategic public health planning, collaboration, and sustained effort to protect and promote health. Cabo Verde's success is the latest in the global fight against malaria, and gives us hope that with existing tools, as well as new ones including vaccines, we can dare to dream of a malaria-free world.” Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. The certification is granted when a country has shown – with rigorous, credible evidence – that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past three consecutive years. A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission. “The certification as a malaria-free country has a huge impact, and it's taken a long time to get to this point. In terms of the country's external image, this is very good, both for tourism and for everyone else. The challenge that Cabo Verde has overcome in the health system is being recognised”, said the Cabo Verde´s Prime Minister, Ulisses Correia e Silva. Cabo Verde, an archipelago of 10 islands in the Central Atlantic Ocean, has faced significant malaria challenges. Before the 1950s, all islands were affected by malaria. Severe epidemics were regular occurrences in the most densely populated areas until targeted interventions were implemented. Through the targeted use of insecticide spraying, the country eliminated malaria twice: in 1967 and 1983. However, subsequent lapses in vector control led to a return of the disease. Since the last peak of malaria cases in the late 1980s, malaria in Cabo Verde has been confined to two islands: Santiago and Boa Vista, which have now both been malaria-free since 2017. “Cabo Verde’s achievement is a beacon of hope for the African Region and beyond. It demonstrates that with strong political will, effective policies, community engagement and multisectoral collaboration, malaria elimination is an achievable goal,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The attainment of this milestone by Cabo Verde is an inspiring example for other nations to follow.” Cabo Verde's journey to malaria elimination has been long and received a boost with the inclusion of this objective in its national health policy in 2007. A strategic malaria plan from 2009 to 2013 laid the groundwork for success, focusing on expanded diagnosis, early and effective treatment, and the reporting and investigating all cases. To stem the tide of imported cases from mainland Africa, diagnosis and treatment were provided free of charge to international travellers and migrants. In 2017 the country turned an outbreak into an opportunity. Cabo Verde identified problems and made improvements, leading to zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the country safeguarded progress; efforts focused on improving the quality and sustainability of vector control and malaria diagnosis, strengthening malaria surveillance - especially at ports, airports, in the capital city and areas with a risk of malaria re-establishment. Collaboration between the Ministry of Health and various government departments focused on the environment, agriculture, transportation, tourism, and more, played a pivotal role in Cabo Verde's success. The inter-ministerial commission for vector control, chaired by the Prime Minister was key to elimination. The collaborative effort and the commitment of community-based organizations and NGOs demonstrate the importance of a holistic approach to public health. As Cabo Verde celebrates this monumental achievement, the global community commends its leaders, healthcare professionals, and citizens for their dedication to eliminating malaria and creating a healthier future for all. Note to the editor WHO malaria-free certification The final decision on awarding a malaria-free certification rests with the WHO Director-General, based on a recommendation by the independent Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification.

Partner quotes: “This is an extraordinary accomplishment, a beacon of hope at a time when climate change threatens to slow down our progress in the global fight against malaria. What’s now crucial is that we do not lower our guard, and help Cape Verde sustain this achievement and prevent reintroduction of malaria. With this aim in mind, we will continue to fund vector control interventions and ensure quality case management and disease surveillance through strengthening health systems for yet another three years.” Peter Sands, Executive Director, Global Fund ""Cabo Verde has proven that with the right tools, access to care, improved case management and surveillance, sustained investment, and engagement across sectors, countries in Africa can achieve dramatic progress against malaria – and even eliminate it entirely. As the malaria community celebrates this victory, let it also serve as a call to action for urgent, sustained efforts and collaboration in the pursuit of malaria eradication and a world where no one suffers from this disease again.” Philip Welkhoff, Director, Malaria Program, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation “Cabo Verde's achievement is a testament to the perseverance of its people and health systems, and demonstrates that with strategic planning, sustained investment, community engagement, and widescale implementation of preventative measures, the eradication of malaria is within reach. This milestone is not only a victory for Cabo Verde, but also for the global community as we strive to eliminate malaria worldwide. Yet, with global cases now 16 million higher than before the pandemic, we must not waiver in our commitment to invest in, implement, and innovate new strategies and tools.” Dr Michael Adekunle Charles, CEO, RBM Partnership to End Malaria “Cabo Verde’s success in malaria elimination is an inspiration for the Asia Pacific Region where several countries are also on the cusp of elimination. This achievement is a living example which demonstrates what remains possible in public health, even amidst the challenging landscape of today. Our heartfelt congratulations to our friends in this archipelago of the Central Atlantic for this momentous achievement; we look forward to countries in Asia Pacific joining them in malaria free status in the near future.” Dr Sarthak Das, CEO, Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance Click image to enlarge For Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact: Collins Boakye-Agyemang Communications and marketing officer Tel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp) Email: boakyeagyemangc [at] who.int (boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int) Nelvino Lima Communication Officer WHO Cabo Verde Email: nlima [at] who.int (nlima[at]who[dot]int) Mobile: +238 9700002 Related Links Cabo Verde Country Profile Broll and photographs"

Cabo Verde, an archipelago of 10 islands in the Central Atlantic Ocean, has faced significant malaria challenges. Before the 1950s, all islands were affected by malaria. Severe epidemics were regular occurrences in the most densely populated areas until targeted interventions were implemented. Through the targeted use of insecticide spraying, the country eliminated malaria twice: in 1967 and 1983. However, subsequent lapses in vector control led to a return of the disease. Since the last peak of malaria cases in the late 1980s, malaria in Cabo Verde has been confined to two islands: Santiago and Boa Vista, which have now both been malaria-free since 2017. “Cabo Verde’s achievement is a beacon of hope for the African Region and beyond. It demonstrates that with strong political will, effective policies, community engagement and multisectoral collaboration, malaria elimination is an achievable goal,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The attainment of this milestone by Cabo Verde is an inspiring example for other nations to follow.” Cabo Verde's journey to malaria elimination has been long and received a boost with the inclusion of this objective in its national health policy in 2007. A strategic malaria plan from 2009 to 2013 laid the groundwork for success, focusing on expanded diagnosis, early and effective treatment, and the reporting and investigating all cases. To stem the tide of imported cases from mainland Africa, diagnosis and treatment were provided free of charge to international travellers and migrants. In 2017 the country turned an outbreak into an opportunity. Cabo Verde identified problems and made improvements, leading to zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the country safeguarded progress; efforts focused on improving the quality and sustainability of vector control and malaria diagnosis, strengthening malaria surveillance - especially at ports, airports, in the capital city and areas with a risk of malaria re-establishment. Collaboration between the Ministry of Health and various government departments focused on the environment, agriculture, transportation, tourism, and more, played a pivotal role in Cabo Verde's success. The inter-ministerial commission for vector control, chaired by the Prime Minister was key to elimination. The collaborative effort and the commitment of community-based organizations and NGOs demonstrate the importance of a holistic approach to public health. As Cabo Verde celebrates this monumental achievement, the global community commends its leaders, healthcare professionals, and citizens for their dedication to eliminating malaria and creating a healthier future for all. Note to the editor WHO malaria-free certification The final decision on awarding a malaria-free certification rests with the WHO Director-General, based on a recommendation by the independent Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification. For more on WHO’s malaria-free certification process, visit this link. Partner quotes: “This is an extraordinary accomplishment, a beacon of hope at a time when climate change threatens to slow down our progress in the global fight against malaria. What’s now crucial is that we do not lower our guard, and help Cape Verde sustain this achievement and prevent reintroduction of malaria. With this aim in mind, we will continue to fund vector control interventions and ensure quality case management and disease surveillance through strengthening health systems for yet another three years.” Peter Sands, Executive Director, Global Fund ""Cabo Verde has proven that with the right tools, access to care, improved case management and surveillance, sustained investment, and engagement across sectors, countries in Africa can achieve dramatic progress against malaria – and even eliminate it entirely. As the malaria community celebrates this victory, let it also serve as a call to action for urgent, sustained efforts and collaboration in the pursuit of malaria eradication and a world where no one suffers from this disease again.” Philip Welkhoff, Director, Malaria Program, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation “Cabo Verde's achievement is a testament to the perseverance of its people and health systems, and demonstrates that with strategic planning, sustained investment, community engagement, and widescale implementation of preventative measures, the eradication of malaria is within reach. This milestone is not only a victory for Cabo Verde, but also for the global community as we strive to eliminate malaria worldwide. Yet, with global cases now 16 million higher than before the pandemic, we must not waiver in our commitment to invest in, implement, and innovate new strategies and tools.” Dr Michael Adekunle Charles, CEO, RBM Partnership to End Malaria “Cabo Verde’s success in malaria elimination is an inspiration for the Asia Pacific Region where several countries are also on the cusp of elimination. This achievement is a living example which demonstrates what remains possible in public health, even amidst the challenging landscape of today. Our heartfelt congratulations to our friends in this archipelago of the Central Atlantic for this momentous achievement; we look forward to countries in Asia Pacific joining them in malaria free status in the near future.” Dr Sarthak Das, CEO, Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance Click image to enlarge For Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact: Collins Boakye-Agyemang Communications and marketing officer Tel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp) Email: boakyeagyemangc [at] who.int (boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int) Nelvino Lima Communication Officer WHO Cabo Verde Email: nlima [at] who.int (nlima[at]who[dot]int) Mobile: +238 9700002 Related Links Cabo Verde Country Profile Broll and photographs"

"WHO Africa, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pursue collaboration to leverage data ...",2024-01-12,"WHO Africa, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pursue collaboration to leverage data analytics to fight diseases 12 January 2024 Brazzaville - The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have committed to strengthening collaboration towards the use of data analytics in the fight against diseases in the African region. The commitment was made during a technical visit to the WHO Africa office in Brazzaville, Congo by a delegation from BMGF led by Jennifer Gardy, Deputy Director, Surveillance, Data, and Epidemiology from 8 to 10 January 2024. The visit provided a platform for the delegation to understand how the WHO Regional Office for Africa’s Precision Public Health Metrics (PPHM) programme is strengthening health and disease modelling in Africa. The PPHM unit was set up as a cross-cutting team within the Universal Health Coverage Communicable and Noncommunicable Diseases (UCN) Cluster in WHO Africa to support all programme areas with data analytics to control, eradicate and eliminate diseases in the African region. “Through precision public health, we are poised to deploy analytics to drive evidence and investments for public health interventions. We welcome the opportunity to build synergies with BMFG and other partners in this effort to leverage data in the fight against diseases,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa. Discussions during the engagement centered on the alignment between the vision and strategies of the UCN cluster and the BMGF, and how this can inform the work of the PPHM programme as it works to support and enhance the use of data analytics at both regional and country level. Furthermore, the WHO Africa Regional Office and BMFG express commitment to continue to work closely, through the UCN Cluster and PPHM, to support the many areas identified for collaboration, with an initial focus on the eradication of malaria in the region. “We recognize the need to leverage data for public health decision-making. We are looking forward to building synergies with the WHO Africa Regional Office to support countries in the region in their efforts to use data-informed solutions to fight disease,” says Jennifer Gardy. PPH was established as a special strategic initiative to deepen the precision public health for Africa (PPH4Africa) strategic initiative, advancing the deployment of analytics towards health systems strengthening and response. This vision is aligned with ongoing efforts to strengthen capacity on epidemiological modelling for public health decision-making in sub-Saharan Africa, already supported by BMFG.

WHO recognition of noma as a neglected tropical disease bolsters control efforts  ,2023-12-26,"© Claire Jeantet - Fabrice Catérini / Inediz Credits WHO recognition of noma as a neglected tropical disease bolsters control efforts 26 December 2023 Brazzaville – The landmark decision by World Health Organization (WHO) to recognize noma (cancrum oris) as one of the neglected tropical diseases will help boost efforts to end the devastating disease especially in the African region which bears the highest burden globally. Noma is a rapidly progressing severe gangrenous disease of the mouth and the face. Like other neglected tropical diseases, noma impacts the most vulnerable and marginalized populations. It mostly affects children aged 2–6 years suffering from malnutrition, affected by infectious diseases, living in extreme poverty with poor oral health, or with weakened immune systems. The true distribution of the disease is unknown; however, cases of noma are mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa, although cases have also been reported in the Americas and Asia. While noma is preventable and treatable at an early stage, the disease progresses rapidly and has a high mortality rate without treatment. Affected children who survive the diseases are often left with serious aesthetic and functional consequences that further contribute to their social isolation, stigmatization, discrimination, and consequently to violations of their human rights. On 15 December, WHO officially recognized noma as one of the neglected tropical diseases following a collective action for health by 32 countries, with the trail-blazing leadership of Nigeria and 14 other African countries (Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, and Senegal). This is a major milestone in the noma control effort. Prior to this recommendation, the noma control effort in sub-Saharan Africa had recorded some progress. This included the development and implementation of the national noma action plan, training of primary care and community health workers by leveraging the online training course for noma towards primary care workers, integration of noma into the existing surveillance system, and enhanced intercountry collaboration for patient referral, e.g., between Benin and Niger. Despite the progress made, many challenges remain. These include lack of up-to-date epidemiological data, substantial knowledge gaps in the cause, and treatment efficacy, prevailing social stigma, and low levels of awareness of noma among healthcare workers and caretakers. There is also very limited attention paid to noma by national health authorities and development partners. All these hinder progress in noma prevention and control. The recognition of noma as a neglected tropical disease will contribute to accelerating an integrated approach to addressing noma in the region. This will include, but not be limited to, integrated active case surveillance of noma during the mass drug administration for other neglected tropical diseases, joint training, social mobilization, as well as leverage the existing other neglected tropical diseases wound management, referral, and support systems for noma treatment. It will also enhance the person-centred approach to health service delivery as well as cross-sectoral collaboration especially in mobilizing for health action, all actors beyond the health sector. The integration can open the door for advocacy, funding, research, and global visibility as well as boosting political commitment. Historical experience from many countries where noma cases used to be observed shows that noma control is possible, alongside eliminating extreme poverty and improving living conditions. “Noma is a deeply devastating disease and a significant public health problem,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa. “By recognizing the noma as a neglected tropical disease, we can capitalize on other ongoing disease control or elimination efforts, coordinate response and galvanize political support to end the disease. Moreover, we can build on the extant collective action of countries to foster a regional coalition against noma in Africa.” Since 2001, WHO Regional Office for Africa has led regional noma control efforts by providing regional strategic guidance, tool, and capacity building of focal points at the Ministry of Health with a view to sustainably reducing the incidence of noma as a public health problem. The Regional Noma Control Programme has focused on integrating noma prevention and control interventions into national health plans as well as contributing to the strengthening of primary health care, moving towards the attainment of universal health coverage. Eleven noma-priority countries located mainly in Western Africa have been supported by the WHO Regional Office for Africa to develop and implement national noma-control programmes, funded by the German nongovernmental organization, Hilfsaktion Noma e.V. since 2013. © Claire Jeantet - Fabrice Catérini / Inediz Credits Click image to enlarge For Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact: Collins Boakye-Agyemang Communications and marketing officer Tel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp) Email: boakyeagyemangc [at] who.int (boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int) Meenakshi Dalal Media Relations Officer WHO Regional Office for Africa Email: dalalm [at] who.int (dalalm[at]who[dot]int) Tel: +254 703 245 761 (WhatsApp) Related Links WHO (2023): Factsheet on noma WHO Regional Office for Africa (2022).

"Senegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health cr...",2023-12-14,"Senegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health crises 14 December 2023 Dakar – The Government of Senegal and World Health Organization (WHO) today inaugurated a regional health emergency hub in the Senegalese capital Dakar to further bolster the African region’s capacity to respond swiftly and effectively to health crises and save lives. Building on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO in Africa has over the past two years worked closely with countries in the region to establish decentralized emergency response systems to ensure an effective response to health crises. Under a transformative initiative, the Organization has embarked on a mission to establish three emergency hubs in the region. The WHO Regional Emergency Hub in Dakar launched today is the second of its kind after WHO and the Government of Kenya launched the Nairobi health emergency hub in 2022. A health emergency hub in Pretoria is planned to be launched in 2024. “This hub, with its various functions that include strategic pre-positioning of emergency health supplies, will enable the WHO Regional Office for Africa to support countries affected by health or humanitarian crises respond faster and in a more structured manner,” said Amadou Ba, Prime Minister of Senegal. The African region faces the highest number of health emergencies globally each year. As of November 2023, the region was grappling with more than 130 disease outbreaks. In West Africa’s Sahel region, more than 33 million people across six countries currently require urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance. The goal of the regional emergency hubs is to substantially reduce – from an average of 45 days previously to three days – the time it takes to deliver life-saving, effective emergency response to countries after a public health event has been declared. This is critical to make meaningful difference in the plight of people affected by crises and to effectively control and end disease outbreaks. The health emergency hubs also serve as centres of excellence, aiming to train more than 3000 African experts, equipping them with key technical skills essential for effective response to health emergencies. Each of the three centres has a specialized function, capitalizing on the comparative advantages afforded by each host country. “I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all those who have contributed to establishing this essential facility,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Our work through this hub aligns with the current global dynamic towards emergency preparedness, vaccine manufacturing, supply chain and effective tools to better respond to public health crises.” The Senegal hub specializes in supply chain management, data analysis, innovation and information management, the Kenya hub focuses on the development of emergency medical personnel, while that in south Africa specializes on research and development, and genomic surveillance. Since September 2022 when the temporary warehouse in Nairobi became operational the delivery time of critical emergency health supplies and equipment within the region has drastically reduced from at least three weeks to an average of three days. The deployment of responders has also been reduced. The Government of Senegal has allocated five hectares of land for the construction of the Regional Emergency Hub in the outskirts of Dakar. The 8000-square-metre building has a 100-person office space. Additionally, the government has allocated 5000-square-metre container yard and is facilitating speedy custom clearance processes for inbound and outbound supplies. The hubs in Kenya and Senegal feature a warehouse for prepositioning medical supplies and equipment, a state-of-the-art training facility, an infectious diseases unit, an emergency response simulation facility and a training camp for health emergency first responders. The Regional Emergency Hubs will work in close cooperation with partners and the broader United Nations ecosystem to support countries. WHO is also collaborating closely with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent.

"WHO Africa welcomes Gavi’s commitment to Africa vaccine manufacture, immunization an...",2023-12-12,"WHO Africa welcomes Gavi’s commitment to Africa vaccine manufacture, immunization and pandemic preparedness 12 December 2023 Brazzaville – The quest to protect Africa from vaccine-preventable diseases has received a significant boost, with the commitment of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to invest US$ 1.8 billion to support African vaccine manufacturing, catching up missed children and pandemic preparedness. The decision taken last week by the Gavi Board at its meeting in Accra, Ghana will help the continent to recover from the impact COVID-19 pandemic and be better prepared to respond to future public health emergencies. This commitment comes at an opportune time when the sub-Saharan African region is witnessing stalled progress in immunization coverage, with the number of African children missing routine vaccinations rising from 6.2 million in 2019 to 7.8 million in 2022, translating into 2.8 million zero-dose children from 2019 to 2022 cumulatively. Furthermore, the establishment of the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), a financing instrument that will make up to US$1 billion, will strengthen ongoing efforts towards local vaccine manufacturing and address vaccine equity gaps identified during the COVID-19 pandemic. “The pandemic highlighted beyond any doubt the critical importance of vaccination as a public health tool. This decision by the Board of Gavi will contribute significantly to saving lives and livelihoods,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa. At the 2023 WHO Africa Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) and the Immunization Stakeholders meeting, experts shared their commitment to advance efforts toward the attainment of global immunization. Therefore, through WHO’s coordination role, the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF), which facilitated the regulatory environment required for COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the RITAG have been positioned and ready to support these commitments by Gavi for a deepened outcome. The WHO Regional Office for Africa also welcomes the decision by Gavi to translate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic into concrete public health interventions, with a US$ 500 million investment to ensure the availability of funds for a future pandemic. The lessons learned from decades of fighting and preventing diseases, including most recently, COVID-19 have led to the vision and strategies, articulated in WHO Africa Regional Office’s Ending Disease in Africa: vision, strategies and Special Initiatives, 2023-2030, which will drive the work moving forward, including the vital acceleration of immunization uptake across the region. Anchored on this new strategy, WHO has supported countries in Africa in the development of innovative country plans to catch up with children who missed routine immunization. This new strategy aligns with Gavi’s focus on protecting the next generation — particularly zero-dose children — through strengthening regional and country capacities on immunization and other diagnostics and therapeutics. “For us as WHO, serving about a billion people in 47 African countries, we welcome the opportunity to strengthen our ongoing collaboration with Gavi, Africa CDC and other partners to translate this latest commitment into action towards ending diseases in Africa,” Dr Moeti said.

This commitment comes at an opportune time when the sub-Saharan African region is witnessing stalled progress in immunization coverage, with the number of African children missing routine vaccinations rising from 6.2 million in 2019 to 7.8 million in 2022, translating into 2.8 million zero-dose children from 2019 to 2022 cumulatively. Furthermore, the establishment of the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), a financing instrument that will make up to US$1 billion, will strengthen ongoing efforts towards local vaccine manufacturing and address vaccine equity gaps identified during the COVID-19 pandemic. “The pandemic highlighted beyond any doubt the critical importance of vaccination as a public health tool. This decision by the Board of Gavi will contribute significantly to saving lives and livelihoods,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa. At the 2023 WHO Africa Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) and the Immunization Stakeholders meeting, experts shared their commitment to advance efforts toward the attainment of global immunization. Therefore, through WHO’s coordination role, the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF), which facilitated the regulatory environment required for COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the RITAG have been positioned and ready to support these commitments by Gavi for a deepened outcome. The WHO Regional Office for Africa also welcomes the decision by Gavi to translate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic into concrete public health interventions, with a US$ 500 million investment to ensure the availability of funds for a future pandemic. The lessons learned from decades of fighting and preventing diseases, including most recently, COVID-19 have led to the vision and strategies, articulated in WHO Africa Regional Office’s Ending Disease in Africa: vision, strategies and Special Initiatives, 2023-2030, which will drive the work moving forward, including the vital acceleration of immunization uptake across the region. Anchored on this new strategy, WHO has supported countries in Africa in the development of innovative country plans to catch up with children who missed routine immunization. This new strategy aligns with Gavi’s focus on protecting the next generation — particularly zero-dose children — through strengthening regional and country capacities on immunization and other diagnostics and therapeutics. “For us as WHO, serving about a billion people in 47 African countries, we welcome the opportunity to strengthen our ongoing collaboration with Gavi, Africa CDC and other partners to translate this latest commitment into action towards ending diseases in Africa,” Dr Moeti said.

The commitment announced this week by the United Arab Emirates, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other donors at the 2023 Reaching the Last Mile Forum held during the COP28 in Dubai will help accelerate progress towards achieving the targets in the World Health Organization(WHO)’s 2030 roadmap on NTDs. This commitment will particularly be critical in the efforts to support sub-saharan African to regain the momentum in the fight against NTDs, having suffered some setbacks due to the impact of COVID19 and the dispropotionate adverse impacts of climate change. “This commitment by the donors and partner is timely and will greatly enhance our ongoing efforts to support countries to adopt integrated people-centered health services to defeat NTDs,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa. Despite challenges, the Africa region has made significant progress in the fight against NTDs. In 2022, the number of individuals requiring NTD interventions decreased by an estimated 80 million. Furthermore 12 countries have been certified for eliminating at least one NTD with Togo achieving global recognition as the first country globally to receive WHO certification for eliminating four NTDs. To consolidate these gains, WHO Africa has stepped up support to countries including developing integrated NTD master plans, promoting strategies such as the integrated screening for skin NTDs, and providing guidance for disease prevention and management. As a region facing severe consequences of climate change-related health risks, WHO is working with countries to urgently adapt strategies to preserve health gains and investments. At the recently conevened NTD Programme Managers’ meeting in the WHO African region, it was agreed to leverage multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms including the one health approach to address the interconnectedness between the environment, development activities, human, plant, and animal health. WHO in Africa has also unveiled a new blueprint to drive the region’s strategy towards ending diseases. “With this new strategy, we welcome the support of all partners towards the vision of ending diseases in Africa,” Dr Moeti said.

Scaling up country support for NTD eradication,2023-12-06,"Scaling up country support for NTD eradication 06 December 2023 Brazzaville - In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) unveiled the neglected tropical diseases (NTD) roadmap 2021-2030, initiating a decade dedicated on controlling, eliminating, and eradicating NTDs. The WHO Regional Office for Africa is stepping up support for countries on the implementation of the roadmap to bolster the fight against NTDs and accelerate progress towards attainment of the roadmap targets and goals. NTDs impose a constant and heavy burden on the poorest, most marginalized, and isolated communities worldwide, with the African Region carrying 39% of the global NTD burden—impacting over 580 million people. To consolidate progress, the WHO Africa regional office, through the Expanded Special Project for the Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN) and the Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases (TVD), organized the NTD Programme Managers meeting. The objective was to discuss challenges, share experiences and opportunities for promoting stronger country ownership for accelerating programmatic action towards the elimination of NTDs. “COVID19 presented a major setback to the fight against diseases in the continent. Therefore, we need to regain our momentum towards controlling, eliminating, and eradicating diseases by ensuring that domestic resources are mobilized and used for integrated person-centered health services,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa. In 2021, the number of individuals requiring NTD interventions decreased by an estimated 80 million, a significant milestone. Furthermore, Togo achieved global recognition as the first country in the WHO African region and globally to receive WHO validation for eliminating four NTDs, alongside certification for interrupting dracunculiasis transmission. The 2023 NTD Programme Managers Meeting addressed key issues such as resource mobilization for funding gaps, and the monitoring of implementation of NTD Master Plans with emphasis on the importance of effective partner coordination at the country level. Recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, managers pledged to collaborate with stakeholders to adopt a one-health approach to combating the diseases. During the 72nd meeting of the WHO Africa Regional Committee, Ministers of Health adopted the Regional Framework for the control, elimination, and eradication of tropical and vector-borne diseases (2022-2030), calling for an integrated and collaborative approach to planning and implementation of interventions, use of data for decision making and building resilient health systems for the elimination of these diseases. WHO’s efforts to support countries included developing integrated NTD masterplans, promoting strategies like the integrated screening for Skin NTDs, and providing guidance for disease prevention and management. NTD Programme managers were urged to prioritize impact evaluations for evidence generation as a crucial to for guiding interventions toward elimination.

Over five days, from 27 November to 1 December, representatives of governments, United Nations agencies, researchers, NGOs, civil society, and migrant and refugee communities gathered in person in Dakar and online to share experiences, identified gaps, highlighted best practices, and worked together towards achieving health equity globally. The e-learning hybrid was web-streamed globally from Dakar, Senegal. “The challenges that refugees and migrants face are like those faced by anyone else, but their migration status often exacerbates their vulnerability”, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “To protect and promote their health, we must address the social determinants of health, by improving health care access without financial impediment; training culturally sensitive health care providers; tackling socio-economic disparities; fighting stigma and discrimination; and offering social integration and support programs.” Africa experiences various migratory patterns, including labour migration, refugee flows, and internal displacement. With over 31 million Africans living outside their home country, the majority within the continent itself, intra-regional migration is prevalent, especially in west and southern Africa. Only 25% of African migrants relocate to Europe. “Refugees and migrants face distinct and significant health threats, with huge hindrances in accessing critical services. As governments work to attain universal health, it is crucial to ensure that no one is left behind, including refugees, migrants and the communities hosting them. This can be achieved through polices and measures that promote, protect and preserve their health and well-being,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. Senegal, with its rapidly growing economy has long been a significant destination for migrants in the region. The WHO Global School provides an opportunity to address the challenges and opportunities related to migration and refugee health globally and in the country. Each year, the WHO Global School is hosted in different regions to foster knowledge exchange and leverage the experiences of countries in addressing the health of refugees and migrants. It is an important platform to build capacity and promote evidence-informed interventions for addressing the health of all people on the move in a comprehensive and equitable manner.

"WHO, partners urge stronger action to accelerate childhood vaccination in Africa",2023-11-30,"WHO, partners urge stronger action to accelerate childhood vaccination in Africa 30 November 2023 Lusaka – With one in five children in Africa still missing basic, life-saving vaccines, World Health Organization (WHO) and partners are calling for accelerated action to reach all children and put the continent back on track to achieve the Immunization Agenda 2030 goals towards reducing illness and deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reversed immunization gains, with the number of zero-dose children rising by 24% in 2022 compared with 2019 and driving up the cumulative total (2019–2022) to an estimated 28 million children – nearly half the global figure. In the African region, only 13 out of 47 countries have met the global target of 90% coverage for the first dose of Diphtheria, Tetanus toxoid and Pertussis-containing vaccines (DTP1). There has been a marked decrease in the number of children receiving crucial immunization, including DTP3 and measles-containing vaccine, underscoring the disruptive impact of the pandemic on Africa's immunization services. The call to step up vaccination efforts in the continent came during a WHO-led side-event titled “Putting Africa back on track to achieve the goals of the Immunization Agenda 2030” at the 3rd International Conference on Public Health in Africa (CPHIA) 2023 in Lusaka, Zambia, held from 27 to 30 November 2023. The Immunization Agenda 2030, a strategy endorsed during the WHO World Health Assembly in 2020 and later adapted into a regional framework for implementation in 2021, seeks to reduce mortality and morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases, ensure equitable access to vaccines and strengthen immunization within primary health care. Zambia's Minister of Health, Hon Dr Sylvia Masebo, stressed the need for continued efforts to keep Africa on track, including building technical capacity, reviewing the Expanded Programme on Immunization policies, and building on lessons learned from the COVID-19 response to strengthen primary healthcare and promote immunization. She also acknowledged the instrumental role of partners like WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in achieving zero-dose targets and expresses Zambia's support for further collaboration to strengthen Africa's progress towards health goals. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, called for stronger collaboration by all to put the region back on track to meet the vaccination targets. “Governments, healthcare institutions, technology companies and civil society organizations must join forces, leveraging their expertise and resources to achieve regional immunization goals,” Dr Moeti said. “By working together and tapping into our collective strengths, we can reach and vaccinate every child.” Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, highlighted the life-saving impact of vaccines in Africa. He emphasized the need to renew commitment to universal health coverage and robust primary health care to ensure sustainable immunization programmes. He stressed the importance of community-level leadership and called for accelerated action to support local vaccine manufacturing. He applauded the efforts by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and expressed anticipation for the African Vaccination Accelerator, which aims to invest over $1 billion in African vaccine manufacturers. The side-event at the CPHIA proposed actions to accelerate the Big Catch-Up vaccination campaign. The proposals include ensuring strong pollical commitment at the country level; optimizing resources through innovations like single-dose vaccines and integration with other health programmes; elimination of health disparities to ensure equitable and affordable vaccine access; expansion of multi-sectoral partnerships, particularly with communities, for more efficient immunization service delivery; and funding mobilization and prioritization for immunization programmes. Keynote speakers during the event included Hon Dr Masebo, Dr Moeti, Dr Kaseya, Mr David Marlow, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and Ms Lieke van de Wiel, Deputy Director of UNICEF in the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office.

Accelerating action for HPV vaccination in Africa,2023-11-29,"Accelerating action for HPV vaccination in Africa 29 November 2023 Lusaka – In an effort to reinforce the fight against cervical cancer in Africa, World Health Organization (WHO) and partners are supporting countries to scale up vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for nearly all cases of cervical cancer. So far, 27 African countries have introduced HPV vaccines in their national immunization programmes, and 34 have started cervical cancer screening programmes, with 14 using human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing (HPV DNA) – a more effective method in detecting and preventing the disease compared with other commonly used screening. At the 3rd International Conference on Public Health in Africa (CPHIA 2023), in Lusaka, Zambia, WHO convened a side-event where stakeholders called for the scaling up of the single-dose HPV vaccine to accelerate progress in eliminating cervical cancer in Africa. The aim of the side-event was to review the current state and future strategies for cervical cancer prevention and treatment on the continent. “We must embrace innovation to revolutionize our approach to cervical cancer prevention. This includes adopting WHO’s one-dose vaccine schedule,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. In 2022, WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization concluded that a single-dose HPV vaccine delivers solid protection against HPV comparable to two-dose schedules. The African countries that have introduced the HPV vaccine had by 2022 delivered the first dose to 33% of girls aged 9–14. Plans to switch to a single-dose regimen in 16 African countries signify progress, but equitable access in West and Central Africa remains a priority. Along with partners including WHO and UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is aiming to reach 86 million adolescent girls in low- and middle-income countries over the next three years with the HPV vaccine. Speakers at the WHO side-event also emphasized the need to strengthen advocacy, particularly on the urgent for community involvement in vaccination efforts. “Get local communities engaged to promote vaccination, as CSO's play a large role,” noted David Marlow, Interim CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, highlighting the importance of community engagement in vaccination efforts. Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasized the importance of including boys in HPV vaccination programmes as part of a comprehensive strategy to combat HPV and cervical cancer. Harnessing advocacy, concentrating on integrating services, and fostering partnerships will expedite the provision of HPV vaccine services to this vulnerable group. Cervical cancer can be prevented and cured; this requires a range of interventions, from vaccines to treatment.

In 2022, WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization concluded that a single-dose HPV vaccine delivers solid protection against HPV comparable to two-dose schedules. The African countries that have introduced the HPV vaccine had by 2022 delivered the first dose to 33% of girls aged 9–14. Plans to switch to a single-dose regimen in 16 African countries signify progress, but equitable access in West and Central Africa remains a priority. Along with partners including WHO and UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is aiming to reach 86 million adolescent girls in low- and middle-income countries over the next three years with the HPV vaccine. Speakers at the WHO side-event also emphasized the need to strengthen advocacy, particularly on the urgent for community involvement in vaccination efforts. “Get local communities engaged to promote vaccination, as CSO's play a large role,” noted David Marlow, Interim CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, highlighting the importance of community engagement in vaccination efforts. Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasized the importance of including boys in HPV vaccination programmes as part of a comprehensive strategy to combat HPV and cervical cancer. Harnessing advocacy, concentrating on integrating services, and fostering partnerships will expedite the provision of HPV vaccine services to this vulnerable group. Cervical cancer can be prevented and cured; this requires a range of interventions, from vaccines to treatment.

Shipments to African countries herald final steps toward broader vaccination against...,2023-11-22,"UNICEF/UNI474929 Credits Shipments to African countries herald final steps toward broader vaccination against malaria 22 November 2023 More than 330,000 doses of WHO-recommended RTS,S malaria vaccine arrived last night in Cameroon – a historic step towards broader vaccination against one of the deadliest diseases for African children Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 95% of global malaria cases and 96% of related deaths in 2021 With several African countries now finalizing rollout plans, an additional 1.7 million doses are set for delivery to Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone in the coming weeks These shipments signal that malaria vaccination is moving out of its pilot phase, and lay the groundwork for countries to begin vaccinations through Gavi-supported routine immunization programmes in Q1 2024 Geneva/New York/Copenhagen/Yaounde – Shipments of the world’s first WHO-recommended malaria vaccine, RTS,S, have begun with 331,200 doses landing last night in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The delivery is the first to a country not previously involved in the malaria vaccine pilot programme and signals that scale-up of vaccination against malaria across the highest-risk areas on the African continent will begin shortly. Nearly every minute, a child under five dies of malaria. In 2021, there were 247 million malaria cases globally, which led to 619,000 deaths. Of these deaths, 77 per cent were children under 5 years of age, mostly in Africa. Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounts for approximately 95% of global malaria cases and 96% of related deaths in 2021. A further 1.7 million doses of the RTS,S vaccine are expected to arrive in Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone in the coming weeks, with additional African countries set to receive doses in the months ahead. This reflects the fact that several countries are now in the final stage of preparations for malaria vaccine introduction into routine immunisation programmes, which should see first doses administered in Q1 2024. Comprehensive preparations are needed to introduce any new vaccine into essential immunisation programmes – such as training of healthcare workers, investing in infrastructure, technical capacity, vaccine storage, community engagement and demand, and sequencing and integrating rollout alongside the delivery of other vaccines and health interventions. Delivering the malaria vaccine has the added challenge of a four-dose schedule which requires careful planning to effectively deliver. Since 2019, Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi have been administering the vaccine in a schedule of 4 doses from around 5 months of age in selected districts as part of the pilot programme, known as the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP). More than 2 million children have been reached with the malaria vaccine in the three African countries through MVIP – resulting in a remarkable 13% drop in all-cause mortality in children age-eligible to receive the vaccine, and substantial reductions in severe malaria illness and hospitalizations. Other key findings from the pilot programme show that vaccine uptake is high, with no reduction in use of other malaria prevention measures or uptake of other vaccines. MVIP is coordinated by WHO in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, and funded by Gavi, the Global Fund, and UNITAID, with donated doses from GSK, the manufacturer of the RTS,S vaccine. The data from the pilot have shown the impact and safety of the RTS,S vaccine and provided important evidence on vaccine acceptability and uptake that helped inform the recent WHO recommendation of a second malaria vaccine – R21, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). Results of a phase 3 trial for R21 showed that the vaccine has a good safety profile in the clinical trial setting and reduces malaria in children. It is expected that, like RTS,S, when R21 is implemented it will have similar high public health impact. The choice of which vaccine to be used in a country should be based on programmatic characteristics, vaccine supply, and affordability. The R21 vaccine is currently under review by WHO for prequalification. The availability of two malaria vaccines is expected to increase supply to meet the high demand from African countries and result in sufficient vaccine doses to benefit all children living in areas where malaria is a public health risk. In preparation for scaled-up vaccination, Gavi, WHO, UNICEF and partners are working with countries that have expressed interest and/or have confirmed rollout plans on the next steps. These developments mean that broad implementation of malaria vaccination in endemic regions has the potential to be a gamechanger for malaria control efforts, and could save tens of thousands of lives each year. However, malaria vaccines are not a standalone solution. They should be introduced in the context of the WHO-recommended package of malaria control measures which include insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women, antimalarials, effective case management, and treatment, all of which have helped to reduce malaria-related deaths since 2000. Importantly, the MVIP showed that delivering vaccines alongside non-vaccine interventions can reinforce the uptake of other vaccines and the use of insecticide treated nets, and overall boost access to malaria prevention measures. “The world needs good news – and this a good news story,” said David Marlow, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “Gavi is proud that our Alliance of stakeholders, with African countries at the forefront, took the decision to invest in the malaria vaccine as a public health priority, and that this support has played a part in the availability of a new tool that can save the lives of thousands of children each year. We are excited to rollout this historic vaccine through Gavi programmes and work with partners to ensure it is delivered alongside other vital measures.” “This could be a real gamechanger in our fight against malaria,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Introducing vaccines is like adding a star player to the pitch. With this long-anticipated step, spearheaded by African leaders, we are entering a new era in immunization and malaria control, hopefully saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children every year.” “This is another breakthrough moment for malaria vaccines and malaria control, and a ray of light in a dark time for so many vulnerable children in the world. The delivery of malaria vaccines to new countries across Africa will offer life-saving protection to millions of children at risk of malaria,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “But we must not stop here. Together, we must find the will and the resources to bring malaria vaccines to scale, so more children can live longer, healthier lives.” “This is a significant advancement towards scaling up malaria vaccination in the region. The vaccine, which protects children from the severe forms of the disease, is a vital addition to the existing set of malaria prevention tools and will help bolster our efforts to reverse the rising trend in cases and further reduce deaths,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. Quotes from countries and stakeholders ""The arrival of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in Burkina Faso marks a historic milestone in our efforts to combat malaria, which remains a major public health threat.

Malawi ‘s ratification of WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control comes into e...,2023-11-16,"Malawi ‘s ratification of WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control comes into effect 16 November 2023 Lilongwe, 16 November 2023 ‒ Today the Government of Malawi’s ratification of the World Health Organization (WHO)’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) came into effect. With this historic decision, Malawi joins a community of 182 other Parties to the Convention, affirming the country’s high-level political commitment to combatting the global tobacco epidemic and prioritizing public health and well-being. The Convention, which Malawi ratified in August 2023, is a crucial international treaty designed to address the severe public health risks associated with tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. Its ratification by Malawi demonstrates the country’s determination to protect present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. “WHO congratulates Malawi for this historic step and reaffirms its strong commitment to collaborating closely with the government to achieve the shared goals of the WHO FCTC,” said Dr Neema Rusibamayila Kimambo, WHO Representative in Malawi. “Together, we will continue our collective efforts to protect public health and work towards a tobacco-free future.” WHO is ready to provide extensive support to ensure Malawi's successful implementation of the Convention and welcomes the nomination of a government liaison to work closely with the WHO FCTC Secretariat. The FCTC, which entered into force in February 2005, provides an internationally co-ordinated response to combating the tobacco epidemic, setting out specific steps for governments addressing tobacco use and production, including adopting tax and price measures to reduce tobacco consumption; banning tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; creating smoke-free work and public spaces; putting prominent health warnings on tobacco packages; and combating illicit trade in tobacco products. Tobacco consumption is the single largest preventable cause of death, killing more than 7 million people globally each year, of which more than 6 million are users or ex-users of tobacco, and around 890 000 are non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke. More than 80% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. While tobacco is harmful for people who consume it or are exposed to tobacco smoke, it is also harmful for the people who plant, cultivate, harvest and process it. WHO estimates that tobacco farmers may absorb nicotine equivalent to smoking 50 cigarettes a day. A key aspect of implementation of the FCTC is to work with tobacco farmers on crop replacement and diversification which also has long-term economic, agricultural and health benefits.

Jointly convened by World Health Organization (WHO) and Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the 8–10 November 2023 meeting in Accra, Ghana, aimed to enhance parliamentary awareness of the ongoing negotiations towards the first-ever global Pandemic Accord to strengthen pandemic prevention, as well as amendments to the International Health Regulations in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lawmakers voiced support for a common African position on the ongoing negotiations of the key global instruments to govern health security. The meeting also discussed the crucial role of parliamentarians in supporting measures for resilient health systems that provide adequate and quality services, while ensuring effective national response to health emergencies. “In these crucial times, our roles as parliamentarians are more important than ever in steering our countries towards health security and resilience,” said Hon Alban Kingsford Suman Bagbin, Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana. Parliamentarians, through their core functions of law-making, budgeting, and oversight, as well as their mandates to represent constituencies, can foster multisectoral action across government, engage in international partnerships, and play a critical role in advancing not only global health security, but also universal health coverage and achieving health under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. “We parliamentarians have a role in promoting health and health equity. We must strive to bridge inequities in access to health care within the populations we serve. Our role in legislation, budget allocation, oversight and ratification of international agreements provides the impetus for us to influence and prioritize health security,” said Hon Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, Ghana’s Minister for Health. The political declarations and outcomes of the conference will complement two global processes – the Inter-governmental Negotiation Body to establish the Pandemic Accord and the Working Group on the amendments of the legally binding International Health Regulations – in a common agenda to address the gaps witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Parliaments and parliamentarians have a decisive role in ensuring these political declarations on universal health coverage and pandemic preparedness and response are translated into action through various responsibilities, from law-making and oversight to budgetary allocation and citizen representation,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. By bringing together the legislators from across the continent, the Parliamentary High-level Conference aims to strengthen multisectoral coordination for health emergency preparedness to contribute to the vision of a strengthened global health architecture. “Better preparedness requires legislation and investment across a number of sectors beyond health; strong and resilient health systems; coordination mechanisms at the national level; regional and global information sharing and cooperation,” said Mr Martin Chungong, the IPU Secretary General. The conference also comes on the back of the WHO African regional health security and emergencies strategy 2023-2030, which was endorsed by the Regional Committee in Lomé, Togo and reaffirmed the importance of effective legislation framework to strengthen preparedness capacities of countries.

Immunizations conference ends with consensus to advance immunization goals in Africa,2023-11-09,"Immunizations conference ends with consensus to advance immunization goals in Africa 09 November 2023 Brazzaville – With one in five children currently missing crucial immunizations, African Immunization experts have pledged to address the pressing issue of vaccine access and equity. Following an intensive and collaborative meeting of the Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo, over 150 immunization experts in the African Region committed to enhancing access and accelerating efforts to protect children from vaccine-preventable diseases. Held over the course of three days, the meeting brought together a diverse group of experts, including experts from WHO, Gavi, UNICEF, government officials, healthcare professionals, and representatives from non-governmental organizations, to discuss and strategize on critical immunization challenges facing the African continent. “This meeting reinforces the importance of collaboration and innovation to achieve our common goal of protecting the health of all African children. We are leaving this meeting with renewed energy and determination to ensure that vaccines reach every corner of the continent,” said Prof Helen Rees, RITAG Chair. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine childhood immunization in the African region cannot be overstated. Gains achieved were not only halted but regressed, with the number of African children missing routine vaccinations rising from 7.7 million in 2020 to nearly 12 million in 2022. The decline in childhood vaccination uptake, has led to the resurgence of diseases such as diphtheria, whooping cough, and yellow fever, with recurrent measles outbreaks in 17 countries. This setback disproportionately affects poor, marginalized communities, as well as those in conflict or fragile settings. The WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti noted that the during the pandemic, the link between the virus, emergencies, and non-communicable diseases, brought to the fore, the importance of integrating disease interventions as the most efficient way to tackle disease burden. The need to integrate all routine immunizations to include adolescents and adults into primary health and chronic disease care was also highlighted. “The pandemic highlighted beyond any doubt the critical importance of vaccination as a public health tool, whose impact saved not only lives, but also livelihoods, and national economies. Very importantly, it vividly pinpointed the need to generate the data required for evidence-based decision-making, and the vital role played by experts in interpreting and using the evidence to inform policy and action, taking regional and national contexts into account,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. The experts were urged to not only use this in your strategic guidance and policy direction on immunization, but also assist in evaluating the effectiveness of EPI programmes, and the way in which RITAG recommendations are used to deliver results. Participants engaged in in-depth discussions and workshops over the course of the meeting, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts and data-driven decision-making in achieving immunization goals. The experts underscored their shared commitment to advancing immunization efforts in the region and aligning with global vaccination initiatives. The outcomes of this gathering will contribute to building resilient immunization systems that can withstand future health challenges and promote health equity throughout Africa. Established in 2016, RITAG advises the WHO African region on vaccination policies. With 15 diverse members, RITAG covers all vaccine-preventable diseases and age groups. Responsibilities include advising on vaccine selection, safety, surveillance, delivery of services, health systems strengthening, and community engagement.

Transitioning from BU-LABNET to Skin NTD LABNET,2023-11-06,"Transitioning from BU-LABNET to Skin NTD LABNET 06 November 2023 Fifth annual meeting adopts recommendation marking pivotal milestone in efforts to address skin-related neglected tropical diseases The network of Buruli ulcer PCR laboratories (BU-LABNET) in the WHO African Region concluded its fifth annual meeting held at the esteemed Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research in Accra, Ghana on 23–25 October 2023. This meeting marked a pivotal milestone in the fight against Buruli ulcer and other skin-related neglected tropical diseases (skin NTDs) in the WHO African Region: the transition of the network from BU-LABNET to Skin NTD LABNET. What is BU-LABNET? Established in 2019 under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO), BU-LABNET is a collaboration of 13 laboratories from nine endemic countries, namely: Benin, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Togo. The network is supported by WHO, American Leprosy Missions (USA), the Anesvad Foundation (Spain) and the Raoul Follereau Foundation (France). Its primary goal is to enhance the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer using standardized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing protocols and external quality assessment programmes. Notably, BU-LABNET envisions expanding its molecular platform to include additional skin NTDs and laboratories, thereby optimizing cost–effectiveness and increasing access to quality-assured diagnosis. Meeting highlights The fifth annual BU-LABNET meeting tackled numerous objectives including a comprehensive review of recommendations from the previous (fourth) meeting in 2022; the presentation of laboratory activities associated with integrating skin NTDs other than Buruli ulcer; communication and advocacy planning; and the development of a road map for 2024–2030. The event brought together over 70 participants from member laboratories, external skin disease experts, national NTD programme managers, officials from the Ghana Health Service and front-line health workers, as well as representatives from partner organizations – Anesvad, American Leprosy Missions and the Raoul Follereau Foundation – demonstrating the global collaborative effort in addressing Buruli ulcer and other skin NTDs. Moreover, the participation of skin NTD experts at national, regional and global levels and representatives from WHO collaborating centres in Spain, Tunisia and Sudan emphasized the importance of the global collective initiative in tackling these diseases. The event was well-supported by WHO NTD focal points from the WHO Country Office in Ghana, the WHO Regional Office for Africa and WHO headquarters. Credit: WHO/Priya Pathak Discussion and recommendations Throughout the 3-day meeting, participants discussed laboratory needs and challenges, harmonization of PCR to include skin NTDs other than Buruli ulcer (cutaneous leishmaniasis, leprosy, mycetoma and yaws) and collaborative research studies. Additionally, a meeting was held with partners to discuss their roles in supporting the transition of BU-LABNET to the Skin NTD Laboratory Network (Skin NTD LABNET). The opening ceremony was a remarkable start to the event. It began with a warm introduction of esteemed guests by Dr Charles Quaye, after which Professor Dorothy Yeboah-Manu, Director of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, delivered a heartfelt welcome address, setting the positive tone for the gathering. “Where we find one skin NTD, we find another, so there is no need for us to work in silos. Working together, we will be able to leverage the limited resources available to improve the health of our people,” she said. Dr Sofonias Asrat, lead of the health systems cluster at the WHO Country Office, representing the WHO Representative for Ghana, emphasized the significance of the occasion: “It is gratifying to know that the network is expanding its expertise to cover other skin NTDs. What is needed most is to build the necessary capacity and ensure the provision of reagents.” The presentations by working groups shed light on efforts to strengthen collaboration between laboratories and national programmes in the areas of specimen collection, storage and transport to member laboratories for testing. The need to enhance collaborative research studies within the network was also discussed. The most significant outcome of the meeting was the transition from BU-LABNET to the Skin NTD Laboratory Network, or Skin NTD LABNET, in alignment with changing global health policy. “The laboratory is a key component of the skin NTD integration vision; this fifth annual BU-LABNET meeting provides an opportunity to promote the importance of harmonization of procedures towards attaining the targets for 2030 of the WHO NTD road map 2021–2030,” added Dr Sara Eyangoh, Coordinator of the BU-LABNET. The meeting concluded with the formulation of general recommendations reaffirming the network’s commitment to providing laboratory support to national programmes to address skin NTDs in the WHO African Region. Recommendations and follow-up The meeting produced significant recommendations, including changing the network’s name to the “Skin NTD Laboratory Network” (Skin NTD LABNET), maintaining the Coordinating Center at the Pasteur Center in Cameroon and revising the organogram of the new network. For WHO, the recommendations involve revising the Memorandum of Understanding with the Pasteur Center in Cameroon to include the new network name and terms of reference, advocating for partner engagement and funding, enhancing collaboration between national programmes and laboratories, and compiling and sharing a database of skin NTD programme managers and coordinators to facilitate communication. The Coordinating Center received recommendations related to developing new terms of reference for the Skin NTD Laboratory Network, preparing a costed work plan for integrating new diseases, harmonizing PCR procedures for new diseases, establishing external quality assessments and finalizing the organogram. Furthermore, recommendations encompassed coordinating the harmonization of standard operating procedures, implementing external quality assessment, enhancing visibility through strategic advocacy and communication, establishing procedures for the inclusion of new laboratories, developing training tools for skin-NTD diagnostics, and promoting collaborative research studies on prioritized topics. BU-LABNET member laboratories were encouraged to enhance collaboration with national control programmes, commit to harmonized standard operating procedures for new diseases, participate in external quality assessments and research submissions, and actively engage in collaborative research studies. National programmes were advised to improve collaboration with laboratories, organize training of trainers or refresher courses for sample collection and transport, and explore integrating transport of skin-NTD samples with other national systems. For partners, the recommendations revolved around supporting the Coordinating Center in achieving the integration objectives, assisting with sample collection in collaboration with member laboratories, and contributing to identifying additional funding sources to sustain the new network’s activities. The fifth annual BU-LABNET meeting marked a significant step forward in ongoing efforts to improve the diagnosis and management of skin diseases and in fostering access to health in endemic regions.

First WHO tri-regional health leadership training gets underway  ,2023-10-30,"First WHO tri-regional health leadership training gets underway 30 October 2023 Brazzaville/Istanbul – In a first of its kind, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa’s Pathways to Leadership for Health Transformation Programme this week gathered experts from three of the Organization’s regional offices to equip them with crucial skills on health leadership to help bolster individual and organizational efforts towards a stronger future for global health. The 30 October to 2 November 2023 training in Istanbul, spearheaded by the WHO O Regional Office for Africa, brings diverse experts from across the African, Eastern Mediterranean and European regional offices with a shared mission on strengthening health leadership. Over the four days, senior leaders from these regions will be equipped with strategies and skills crucial for revamping WHO outcomes in their offices. The primary goal is straightforward yet profound: to offer high-calibre leadership training and strategic support to senior leaders, empowering them to bring about significant change in health outcomes. This workshop is part of a three-month programme that seeks to produce agile leaders who can navigate the ever-evolving health landscape and drive impactful reforms. “The presence of participants from diverse regions enriches our understanding of other people’s ways, exchange of best practices, and robust network of WHO leaders adept at navigating the intricate challenges of the contemporary healthcare landscape,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The knowledge and skills acquired here are not just for individual development; they are instruments you carry back to your regions, enabling you to spearhead transformative initiatives, inspire your teams, and contribute to the overarching objective of global health equity,” Dr Moeti added. Since its inception in 2018, the Pathways to Leadership for Health Transformation Programme has empowered over 250 senior WHO staff from different regions, as well as more than 150 senior officials from the Ministries of Health in Congo, Benin, Ghana, Niger, and Lesotho. “Learning and development is a priority for (WHO Regional Director for Europe) and good leadership is key to implementing our work,” said Ms Gabrielle Jacob, Special Advisor (Transformation & Organization Development) at the WHO Regional Office for Europe. “W we are very committed to greater and deeper collaboration between Regional Offices and this is another great example - our three offices have shown how collaboration builds bridges to make us truly ‘one WHO’.” She noted that there has been an overwhelmingly positive response from colleagues who have participated in previous editions of the programme. “We thank Dr Moeti, (WHO Regional Director for Europe) Dr Kluge and (WHO Regional Director for Eastern Mediterranean) Dr Al-Mandhari for their visionary leadership that has enabled the collaboration between the three regions”, she added. The programme's architecture is built upon the twin pillars of self-reflection and continuous learning. Recognizing the fluid nature of the health landscape, the workshop prioritizes the cultivation of agile leaders with appropriate skills needed to guide health sector reforms in various countries. To ensure lasting impact, the Istanbul workshop is meticulously structured. Participants embark on a transformative journey, beginning with an immersion into pre-workshop materials. This initial groundwork enables in-depth exploration during the in-person sessions, where they engage with self-awareness tools, theoretical models for appreciative leadership, coaching and team performance, and reflective exercises. The programme's effectiveness lies in its practical application phase. During this stage, participants collaborate closely with professional coaches accredited by the International Coaching Federation to test and apply their newly gained insights in real-life health situations, ensuring that theoretical knowledge transforms into tangible, practical outcomes. “This leadership course has a very strong track record. We appreciate the vision from our WHO colleagues in AFRO to make it a learning platform across regions, this time including among others 23 senior managers working in countries between Morocco and Pakistan, many of them dealing with different emergencies, conflicts and other crises. We surely need strong leaders in such environments,” said Dr Christoph Hamelmann, Chef de Cabinet at WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. Dr Kizito Nsarharza, Strategic Advisor for the Transformation Agenda at WHO Regional Office for Africa said: “While the Istanbul meeting is time-bound, its aspirations are timeless. By equipping participants with indispensable skills and knowledge, the program seeks to create lasting ripples throughout WHO and beyond. This isn't just about individual growth; it's about collectively elevating health outcomes and ensuring sustainable progress across the board.” The programme, with its blend of reflection, learning and application, is aimed at redefining health leadership for the better. By intertwining the expertise from Africa, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean regions, it not only paves the way for innovative solutions but also reinforces the belief that we are stronger and more impactful together.

Nigeria to vaccinate 7.7 million girls against leading cause of cervical cancer,2023-10-24,"Nigeria to vaccinate 7.7 million girls against leading cause of cervical cancer 24 October 2023 Abuja, 24 October 2023 – Nigeria today introduced the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into its routine immunization system, aiming to reach 7.7 million girls – the largest number in a single round of HPV vaccination in the African region – in a vaccination drive against the virus that causes nearly all cases of cervical cancer. Girls aged 9–14 years will receive a single dose of the vaccine, which is highly efficacious in preventing infection with HPV types 16 and 18 that are known to cause at least 70% of cervical cancers. In Nigeria, cervical cancer is the third most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer deaths among women aged between 15 and 44 years. In 2020 – the latest year for which data is available – the country recorded 12 000 new cases and 8000 deaths from cervical cancer. “The loss of about 8000 Nigerian women yearly from a disease that is preventable is completely unacceptable,” says Muhammad Ali Pate, the Coordinating Minister of Health & Social Welfare. “Cervical cancer is mostly caused by HPV, and parents can avoid physical and financial pain by protecting their children with a single dose of the vaccine. Saving lives, and producing quality health outcomes and protecting the wellbeing of Nigerians are central to the Renewed Health Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The onset of the vaccination campaign is an opportunity to safeguard our girls from the scourge of cervical cancers many years into the future. As a parent myself, I have four daughters, all of them have had the same HPV vaccine to protect them against cervical cancer. I’d like to implore fellow parents to dutifully ensure that this generation of our girls disrupt the preventable loss of lives to cervical cancer in addition to other untold hardship, loss, and pain.” A five-day mass vaccination campaign in schools and communities will be carried out during the inaugural rollout in 16 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The vaccine will then be incorporated in routine immunization schedules with in health facilities. The second phase of the vaccination introduction is set to start in May 2024 in 21 states. The vaccine is being provided for free by the Federal Ministry of Health through the National Primary Health Care Development Agency with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners. With support from WHO country office in Nigeria and other partners, over 35 000 health workers have so far been trained in preparation for the campaign and subsequent vaccine delivery in all health facilities. Vaccination sites have been established in all 4163 wards across the 16 states included in the phase one rollout to ensure no eligible girl is left behind. Mobile vaccination units have also been set up to ensure that remote communities can access the vaccine. “This is a pivotal moment in Nigeria’s efforts to lower the burden of cervical cancer – one of the few cancers which can potentially be eliminated through vaccination,” said Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, WHO Representative in Nigeria. “We’re committed to supporting the government increase access to the HPV vaccine to protect the health and well-being of the next generation of women.” WHO recommends that HPV vaccination is included in the national immunization programmes of countries where cervical cancer is a public health priority, where its cost-effective and sustainable implementation is feasible. As such, Nigeria has prioritized the addition of the vaccine to the country’s routine immunization schedule. Global supply shortages have slowed Gavi-supported vaccine introductions. These supply issues are now easing thanks to years of market shaping efforts to develop a more robust HPV vaccine market, and the single dose recommendation. Recognizing this critical opportunity to reach more girls with higher levels of global HPV vaccine supply and renewed momentum towards accelerating efforts to prevent cervical cancer, the Gavi board approved the revitalization of its HPV vaccine programme with an investment of over US$ 600 million by end of 2025. With the additional funding, Gavi and its partners have set an ambitious goal to reach over 86 million girls by 2025, aiming to avert over 1.4 million future deaths from cervical cancer. “Every day, cervical cancer inflicts profound loss and devastation on families across Nigeria. It also disproportionately impacts the lives of women. And yet, it is a disease that can be prevented. With the HPV vaccine now available in Nigeria for eligible adolescent girls at no cost, communities now have the most effective tool to fight cervical cancer and the nation has an opportunity, collectively to save millions of lives,” says Thabani Maphosa, Managing Director of Country Programmes Delivery at Gavi. Over 16 million girls could be protected in Nigeria alone by 2025.To support these efforts in Nigeria and in line with its goal to build sustainable immunisation programmes, Gavi is co-financing the cost of the vaccines and providing technical support for the introduction. UNICEF has procured nearly 15 million HPV vaccines on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. Alongside this, the children’s agency has produced informational materials, including radio and TV jingles in multiple local languages to dispel misinformation and rumours. To further the outreach, UNICEF also supported academia and researches with two rounds of readiness assessments to understand the population’s sentiments on HPV and the vaccine. Additionally, UNICEF has facilitated logistical support for vaccination campaigns and distributed cold chain equipment for vaccine preservation. ""In our shared quest for a brighter future, the introduction of the HPV vaccine in Nigeria represents a monumental stride towards safeguarding our girls from the grips of cervical cancer. This vaccine doesn't just prevent a disease; it promises a life where our young women can thrive, unburdened by the spectre of this grave health concern. UNICEF, in collaboration with the government and other partners, is proud to be a key partner in this initiative, ensuring that every eligible girl, irrespective of her location or circumstances, has access to this life-saving intervention. Together, we are scripting a narrative of hope, resilience, and a healthier Nigeria,"" says Cristian Munduate, UNICEF Representative in Nigeria.

Nigeria to vaccinate 7.7 million girls against leading cause of cervical cancer,2023-10-24,"Nigeria to vaccinate 7.7 million girls against leading cause of cervical cancer 24 October 2023 Abuja, 24 October 2023 – Nigeria today introduced the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into its routine immunization system, aiming to reach 7.7 million girls – the largest number in a single round of HPV vaccination in the African region – in a vaccination drive against the virus that causes nearly all cases of cervical cancer. Girls aged 9–14 years will receive a single dose of the vaccine, which is highly efficacious in preventing infection with HPV types 16 and 18 that are known to cause at least 70% of cervical cancers. In Nigeria, cervical cancer is the third most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer deaths among women aged between 15 and 44 years. In 2020 – the latest year for which data is available – the country recorded 12 000 new cases and 8000 deaths from cervical cancer. “The loss of about 8000 Nigerian women yearly from a disease that is preventable is completely unacceptable,” says Muhammad Ali Pate, the Coordinating Minister of Health & Social Welfare. “Cervical cancer is mostly caused by HPV, and parents can avoid physical and financial pain by protecting their children with a single dose of the vaccine. Saving lives, and producing quality health outcomes and protecting the wellbeing of Nigerians are central to the Renewed Health Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The onset of the vaccination campaign is an opportunity to safeguard our girls from the scourge of cervical cancers many years into the future. As a parent myself, I have four daughters, all of them have had the same HPV vaccine to protect them against cervical cancer. I’d like to implore fellow parents to dutifully ensure that this generation of our girls disrupt the preventable loss of lives to cervical cancer in addition to other untold hardship, loss, and pain.” A five-day mass vaccination campaign in schools and communities will be carried out during the inaugural rollout in 16 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The vaccine will then be incorporated in routine immunization schedules with in health facilities. The second phase of the vaccination introduction is set to start in May 2024 in 21 states. The vaccine is being provided for free by the Federal Ministry of Health through the National Primary Health Care Development Agency with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners.

Eritrea empowered the health workers on Essential care during Labor and Birth (ECL&B...,2023-10-14,"Eritrea empowered the health workers on Essential care during Labor and Birth (ECL&B), Early Essential Newborn Care, and Safer use of oxygen 14 October 2023 Eritrea is one of the first countries in the WHO/AFRO region that conducted the Training of Trainers (TOT) on coaching and mentoring on Essential care during Labour and Birth (ECL&B), Early Essential Newborn Care, and Safer use of oxygen during October 9-14, 2023. This was conducted with the leadership of the Ministry of Health, Eritrea, and the joint support of WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA both technically and financially. The technical support included the regional offices of the three UN agencies WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA using the recently published WHO updated management of Maternal and Essential Newborn Care documents. As more than one-third of maternal deaths, an estimated 42·3% of stillbirths, and 11·6% of neonatal deaths result from complications during labour and childbirth. Most of these deaths occur in low-resource settings and are preventable through timely interventions. With the management and avoidance of unnecessary interventions, complications can be minimized. Across the continuum of care, improving the quality of care at the time of childbirth and the period immediately after birth has been identified as the strategy having the greatest potential impact on the reduction of stillbirths and maternal and newborn deaths. Accordingly, this training on Essential Care During Labour & Birth, Early Essential Newborn Care and Safe Oxygen Use was organized. It is designed in modules of Helping Mothers Survive (HMS) Essential Care for Labour & Birth (ECL&B to help providers to give supportive care and close monitoring to women and improve the quality and experience of care for women and newborns during labour, birth, and the immediate postpartum period. ECL&B builds the capacity of the entire team of providers to give evidence-based, respectful care using the Low Dose, High-Frequency (LDHF) approach. Training occurs onsite and was conducted in Orotta referral hospital and Edaga Hamus Maternity Hospital, to improve communication and teamwork and to promote local problem solving with a key component of HMS of short set of LDHF skills practice and quality improvement activities done by providers after training day. The trainees included medical doctors, senior midwives and maternal and newborn program managers and was facilitated by the MOH including the National Obstetricians and paediatricians in the country, WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA Regional and Country Offices. This is to empower the clinicians as well as the program managers in their daily work and mainly to cascade the training to all health workers in all regions and districts of the country. After completion, a costed action plan was presented by each region and the three UN agencies guaranteed to support the plan. Certificates were awarded for the trainees and facilitators and necessary training materials were provided to the trainees to go to their respective regions and conduct this training. The Ministry of Health appreciated the joint support and called for accelerated action and increased investments for Eritrea to meet the SDG targets by 2030 as has been done for MDG.

"""Closing the care gap - the role of families"" in Breast Cancer battle. ",2023-10-13,"Winile Mavuso, Communications Assistant. Credits ""Closing the care gap - the role of families"" in Breast Cancer battle. 13 October 2023 The Ministry of Health, Cancer Unit has recorded 577 cases of cancer between January 2023 and June 2023, 33 of which are cancers of the breast. While many cancer patients in middle-income countries succumb to the disease, 50-year-old Fikile Hlatjwayo is lucky to have survived the deadly disease. Hlatjwayo was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 and started treatment, which at that time was only available in South Africa through the Phalala Fund. It was only in 2022 that the Ministry of Health established an oncology unit in Manzini, through support from the Bristol Myer Squibb Foundation (BMSF). This came as a relief to cancer patients like Hlatjwayo as services became available in the country. This enabled patients to receive not only medical support but also support from family, true to this year’s theme of Global Breast Cancer Awareness month “Closing the care gap, the role of families”. The establishment of the oncology unit enabled the Ministry of Health to construct a radiation facility. The official opening of Manzini Oncology Hospital has witnessed an increase in the number of clients accessing services and the only facility that provides strictly cancer in-patient care. This has eased the burden on Mbabane Government Hospital, which was the only center that provided chemotherapy services, and reduced the referral to neighboring countries/private facilities. Currently, the hospital has one Oncologist who works in both Manzini and Mbabane Hospital. Further, the Ministry of Health has assigned some Medical Officers to work in the Oncology Unit. Hlatjwayo says the availability of cancer treatment in local facilities has lessened the stress of having to spend a lot of time away from her family whilst receiving treatment in neighboring countries. “I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 and I received treatment again in 2022 because some cancer cells were found in my lungs, but now I am okay. I would like to thank my husband and my children for the support that they gave me throughout my journey with cancer,” she said. During the launch of the Global Breast Cancer Awareness month in Mbabane, Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Health Khanyakwezwe Mabuza mentioned that this year’s theme indeed focused on the role played by family in giving hope and support to cancer patients and overcoming stigma. Mabuza said, just like Hlatjwayo’s family, awareness and education can enable families to create a better place for all those who need care and support. “Understanding and acquiring knowledge about the condition of the sick relative, treatment options that are available and the importance of preventive care empowers families to actively participate in the health care discussion. There is no doubt that without families there is no way we can survive or conquer this scourge,” he said. The PS outlined that families can foster an inclusive natural environment where individuals feel safe to express their needs. He added that having breast cancer is not an easy road, so by promoting open communication, families can contribute to breaking down the barriers and stigma that surrounds the disease. “There is a lot of misconception with regards to breast cancer, and families become advocates for the loved ones. This allows the individuals to seek healthcare without fear of judgment and discrimination, he said. Mabuza further emphasized that the Ministry of Health has prioritized cancer control and has ensured universal cancer prevention. He further applauded the Eswatini Breast and Cervical Cancer Network as well as Eswatini Hospice at Home, among others, for ensuring that cancer patients receive the necessary support. Speaking at the same event, WHO Representative Dr Susan Tembo mentioned that globally, there are more than 2.3 million cases of breast cancer that occur each year, which makes it the most common cancer among adults. In 95% of countries, breast cancer is the first or second leading cause of female cancer deaths, and nearly 80% of deaths from breast and cervical cancer occur in low- and middle-income countries like Eswatini. Dr Tembo reiterated that breast cancer places a tremendous strain on individuals, families, communities, health systems, and economies, hence it must be a priority for the Ministry of Health and Government. “Cancer in women including breast cancer leaves a devastating impact on the next generation. A study on cancer, suggests that with an estimated 4.4 million women dying of cancer in 2020, nearly 1 million children were orphaned by cancer, 25% of which were due to breast cancer. Children who lose their mothers to cancer experience health and educational disadvantages throughout their lives, triggering generational, chronic social disruption and financial harm in many cases,” she said. To mitigate the burden of breast cancer, WHO has released a number of tools including the Global Breast Cancer Initiative Framework which provides a roadmap to attain the targets to save 2.5 million lives from breast cancer by 2040. The new Framework recommends that countries implement the three pillars of health promotion for early detection, timely diagnosis, and comprehensive management of breast cancer to reach the targets. Dr Tembo further urged the Government of Eswatini to ensure that this framework is integrated into primary health care, not only to advance health promotion but also to empower women to seek and receive health care throughout the life cycle.

Three African countries pilot initiative to boost cervical and breast cancer care,2023-09-22,"Three African countries pilot initiative to boost cervical and breast cancer care 22 September 2023 Brazzaville/New York – An initiative to support better access to breast and cervical cancer detection, treatment and care services is being piloted in three African countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, with support from Roche, announced the initiative today on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. The programme is being launched in Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya and Zimbabwe to provide cancer care services over the next three years. Breast and cervical cancer currently constitute over half the cancer burden for women in sub-Saharan Africa. Between 60%–70% of women in African countries are diagnosed at a late stage, and only one in two women diagnosed with breast cancer in an African country will survive five years. Breast cancer five-year survival rates in high-income countries exceed 90%. The initiative in the three countries includes health promotion, screening, early diagnosis and treatment, as well as general primary care and screening for other noncommunicable diseases. In addition, early detection services will be integrated into existing cervical cancer screening clinics to ensure both old and new systems are unified. The aim is to provide an integrated and holistic system of health care that will contribute to addressing the burden of breast and cervical cancer in the African region. “Early detection is a key contributor to better cancer treatment outcome. With this approach, we aim to bolster the role of primary health care services to help avert excess mortality of African women from preventable cancers,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The health of women will always be reflected in the health of our nations, and we are proud to take these steps to tackle these treatable diseases, for the good of women, our communities and our countries.” Early detection is, however, hindered by lack of awareness of the disease, combined with limited access to early detection, diagnosis and treatment services. According to the 2018 Global Survey of Clinical Oncology Workforce, a single oncologist provides care for between 500 and 1000 patients in many African countries. This is up to four times the International Atomic Energy Agency recommendation of 200 to 250 patients per oncologist. Extremely low expenditure on health compounds the challenge. A 2019 British Medical Journal analysis determined that only about 2% of official bilateral and multilateral development aid is targeted at noncommunicable diseases, including breast and cervical cancer, The African region accounts for only 1% of world health expenditure, despite having 24% of the global disease burden, according to a 2019 report by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The new initiative being rolled out in the three African countries will also seek to increase health care worker’s ability to provide cancer care within communities through training and will supply and deliver the necessary equipment and essential supplies to support women at primary health care level. “This programme marks an exciting and tangible step on the path to true health equity in Africa and demonstrates a new way in which the public and private sector can work together to drive real change within health care systems,” said Maturin Tchoumi, Roche Pharma International Area Head, Africa. Despite being preventable and curable through screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, cervical cancer remains the most common cause of all cancer-related deaths in African countries. Together with partners, WHO is supporting countries to scale up screening, early detection treatment and care of breast and cervical cancers among women in sub-Saharan Africa.

This is up to four times the International Atomic Energy Agency recommendation of 200 to 250 patients per oncologist. Extremely low expenditure on health compounds the challenge. A 2019 British Medical Journal analysis determined that only about 2% of official bilateral and multilateral development aid is targeted at noncommunicable diseases, including breast and cervical cancer, The African region accounts for only 1% of world health expenditure, despite having 24% of the global disease burden, according to a 2019 report by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The new initiative being rolled out in the three African countries will also seek to increase health care worker’s ability to provide cancer care within communities through training and will supply and deliver the necessary equipment and essential supplies to support women at primary health care level. “This programme marks an exciting and tangible step on the path to true health equity in Africa and demonstrates a new way in which the public and private sector can work together to drive real change within health care systems,” said Maturin Tchoumi, Roche Pharma International Area Head, Africa. Despite being preventable and curable through screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, cervical cancer remains the most common cause of all cancer-related deaths in African countries. Together with partners, WHO is supporting countries to scale up screening, early detection treatment and care of breast and cervical cancers among women in sub-Saharan Africa.

Malawi convenes Cholera outbreak review,2023-09-22,"Malawi convenes Cholera outbreak review 22 September 2023 On August 16, 2023, the Ministry of Health declared Malawi’s biggest Cholera outbreak in history as a no longer a public health emergency. In line with the World Health Organization African guidelines on the aftermath of an outbreak, the Ministry of Health has convened After Action Review AAR meetings at sub-national level to review the Cholera outbreak. The AAR presents an opportunity to share lessons, challenges and best practices demonstrated by the response for continued improvement of outbreak management. According to WHO’s Dr Gertrude Chapotera, the stepwise AAR guideline was developed for countries to use as they review and document how they responded to a particular emergency. As to what was done, what went well and what did not go well by establishing the enabling and limiting factors across the entire response. “The process summarizes best practices to inform next response, formulate key recommendations to utilize on emergency preparedness of any upcoming emergency of similar nature. This process enables countries to identify gaps and develop standardized best practices for outbreak management cutting across all pillars of outbreak management. Risk communication and community management, surveillance, case management, supplies, operations, and logistics as well as the overall health management”, Chapotera said. Dr Mira Khadka for UNICEF Malawi collaborates by stressing on the need to remember each action taken by running through a structured timeline going district by district to establish a common picture of the cholera outbreak. Starting at what was there before the outbreak to the point where the first case was registered. Recording the events as they happened in a sequence up until the management of the very last case to holistically appreciate the outbreak and interventions made to map out key milestones of the emergency. Dickson Kazembe, Environmental Health Officer for Zomba district says it is an important process as it allows room for self-evaluation on what was missed out and how to do better. He mentions that this cholera outbreak was the first time Zomba has had registered cases from the Mental Hospital. The team from Zomba says it will adopt the process not only for the cholera outbreak but as a routine for health service delivery at district level and other future outbreaks using similar strategies and channels as standard practice. Neno’s Disease Surveillance Cordinator Sekanawo Kapila elaborates that this process saves as a reminder for emphasis on prevention interventions as it recollects the memory of the gravity of the outbreak, underscoring on the need for preparedness for effective management of any health crisis. He cites that what the intervention that worked for Neno district was the game changer, installation of 640 chlorine dispensers across the district with support from WHO, Ministry of Health, Partners in Health and UNICEF. Commenting on the issue Dr Limbani Mwapata a member of the Emergency Medical Team from Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital says the discourse dominating the After-Action Review from all districts exposes the need to have a centrally placed contingency fund for any disease outbreak that can significantly support government to address the outbreak whilst lobbying for support from developing partners. Participants are Directors of Health Services, Environmental Health Officers, Medical Officers, Clinicians, Nurses, Pharmacists, Health Logisticians, Surveillance teams, Health Promotion and Communication Officers, Water and Sanitation Hygiene specialists and Immunization Officers. At the end of this AAR process an After Action Review report will be formulated to ensure all lessons are captured and utilized to improve emergency preparedness and management capacities. This process is in alignment with the Global Roadmap targeting 90 percent reduction in Cholera deaths and elimination of cholera by 2030. Click image to enlarge"

Enhancing polio vaccination campaign quality in Madagascar,2023-09-22,"Enhancing polio vaccination campaign quality in Madagascar 22 September 2023 Antananarivo – Quality assurance surveyor Anja Mandimbisoa arrives at a random lot numerically selected, throws her pen in the air, and whichever house it is pointing at when it lands is the next on her evaluation list. With their consent, she then sits down with the family to verify whether the children in the household have the mark on their little fingers confirming they have been vaccinated against polio. “The fact that it is a random selection provides a true picture of immunization coverage at the district level,” explains Mandimbisoa, one of 16 external Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) surveyors trained by World Health Organization (WHO) in Analamanga region, Madagascar, to identify any missed children. As the country concludes its third round of polio vaccinations this year, the response reflects that the job to end polio does not end with the conclusion of a vaccination round. Instead, it is the actions between rounds that make all the difference. Thanks to comprehensive post-campaign evaluations, Madagascar has managed to improve the effectiveness of the campaign from 63% in the first vaccination round in May 2023 to 86% in the second (July 2023), and to 88% in the third round in September. This improvement offers hope for the containment of the variant poliovirus outbreak that began in September 2020. Since then, a total of 49 people have been paralysed and 226 samples have tested positive for polio variant type 1 circulation. Uniquely, two of the cases reported in 2023 are adults, aged 32 and 29. Led by Madagascar’s Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and health partners from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), the most recent national vaccination campaign successfully delivered more than 18 million vaccine doses between 5–8 September 2023. Teams on the ground immunized nearly 19 million people at risk of contracting this debilitating virus, which can cause paralysis and even death in a matter of days. WHO not only considers quantitative data, but also qualitative indicators. Lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS), a tool that originated in the 1920s as a quality control methodology in the manufacturing sector, is now proving useful in the public health context. Supplementary immunization activities are key for polio eradication. They are intended to complement, not replace routine immunization, and aim to interrupt circulation of poliovirus by immunizing every child under five years of age with two doses of oral polio vaccine, regardless of previous immunization. Regular data monitoring following a vaccination drive can be unreliable. It can, for instance, show high coverage levels in virtually all areas, including those where the virus could be circulating. To address this challenge, WHO introduced digital LQAS in 2009. This survey method assesses evidence of campaign quality following supplementary immunization activities in pre-defined areas (known as “lots”), using a small sample size. The survey identifies lots with insufficient evidence of high vaccination coverage, based on the results of a sample of 60 children located in six randomly selected lots (settlements, villages, zones, areas, etc). For vaccination coverage to be considered acceptable, at least 57 of the 60 children must have the vaccination mark on the little finger of their left hand. “The secret is to properly prepare the next round of vaccination as the current one ends, assessing risks, lessons learned, and quickly agreeing on the next vaccine order to halt polio transmission in Madagascar. Key indicators, such as LQAs, are critical to identify the areas we need to focus on so that we can better support the country, technically and financially,” explains Dr Laurent Musango, WHO Representative in Madagascar. Once the surveyors have completed their work in a district, the results are archived and shared via the electronic Open Data Kit tool, which allows for timely submission of data to the central level. WHO epidemiologist Dr Yvonne Kabenga, in Madagascar to supervise the activity and observe the results of the latest vaccination round in Analamanga, in central Madagascar, says they realized during the assessment phase that the marking ink was fading very quickly. “That is either because the quality of the markers was not ideal or because the vaccinators were not marking the children properly. We have noted this for the next round, so we ensure we procure better markers and better instruct the vaccination teams,” she explains. The independent monitors also support evaluation efforts during the campaign and, using this detailed data, Madagascar has quickly implemented lessons learned from previous vaccination rounds, focusing on key priority areas at risk for further spread of polio. As a result, the coordination system has been strengthened at central, regional, district and community levels. National health authorities, with WHO support, have also enhanced both environmental and active surveillance to identify potential cases, and WHO is now considering opening new environmental surveillance sites to collect additional wastewater samples in locations where the virus may be circulating. In addition, teams now identify people eligible for vaccination ahead of the door-to-door campaigns, sensitizing them through briefings and the dissemination of key messages. This work is conducted in collaboration with political, religious and traditional leaders to address misinformation that could lead to refusal of vaccination. Dr Ndoutabe Modjirom, polio Rapid Response Team Lead at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, confirms that Madagascar must continue its valuable work to ""to reach under-immunized children and adults to protect them against all antigens, not only polio, and to avert resurgence in the future”.

In its 75 years of existence as the leading health organization in the world and in Africa, WHO has come a long way. And even if there are still many challenges to overcome in achieving “Health for All”, especially in Africa, WHO has distinguished itself by leading many initiatives that have contributed to improving the health and well-being of populations around the world. These achievements would not be possible without the will, commitment and dedication of men and women of every country in the world. On the occasion of the celebration of its 75 years of existence this year, on the margins of the 73rd session of WHO Regional Committee for Africa, the Regional Office paid well-deserved tribute to the eminent personalities who have contributed, over the past seven decades, to the fulfilment of its noble goals. In the main hall of the Gaborone International Conference Centre (GICC) on August 29, 2023, former Regional Directors of WHO AFRO, ministers, heads of partner agencies and institutions were honoured in the presence of the President of the Republic of Botswana, His Excellency Dr Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi, the Vice-President Mr Slumber Tsogwane, Minister of Health and Well-being Dr Edwin Dikoloti, the former President of the Republic Festus Mogae and his wife, the Director General of WHO Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus Adhanom, and Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. The ceremony, rich in colour, wonderful speeches and edifying testimonies, was also an opportunity to retrace the great victories achieved by the organization in terms of health and well-being of the African population. Also applauded were the major challenges overcome by each of the Member States, with the support of WHO and other partners, towards the achievement of UHC and a continent free from various health threats. In his opening remarks, Botswana’s Vice-President Mr Tsogwane highlighted his country’s achievements, with the support of WHO, in the fight against epidemics, towards controlling both communicable and noncommunicable diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, polio, cervical cancer, as well as increasing vaccination coverage. These remarkable results were thanks to innovative policies and strategies based on promotion of primary health care, he stressed. Dr Moeti warmly thanked GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the African Union and all other partners for their invaluable support for the success of WHO's ambitions for health and well-being of African populations. She also retraced WHO’s path, and its major milestones, since its creation in 1948. These include the fight against infectious diseases, the development of onchocerciasis and meningitis programmes, the introduction of vaccines, the championing of access to primary health care. Notable tangible results from these initiatives had contributed to an increase in life expectancy and a reduction in HIV infections, she said. Dr Moeti invited Member States to invest in their youth, who are the future of the continent, and in the value of research and technology, while reaffirming her commitment to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The commemoration of WHO’s 75th anniversary, on the sidelines of RC73, also served as a framework to honour and decorate eminent personalities, who through their various contributions and commitment, carried the torch of the organization high. The awards were presented to recipients or representatives of their governments, and included Botswana’s former President Festus Mogae and all five former WHO Regional Directors for Africa, four of them posthumously. Other recipients included Dr Assamoah Baah, WHO’s former Assistant Director General; John Nkengasong, Global AIDS Coordinator of the US and pioneering Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control; Congolese researcher Francine Ntoumi; Dr Ndong Edo from Equatorial Guinea, and Sister Marie-Blanche Kambire from Burkina Faso. Speaking on behalf of the awardees, Dr Luis Sambo, former WHO Regional Director for Africa, congratulated Botswana for its great achievements in the health sector, achievements of which he said Africa and the world were immensely proud.

Developing human resource for health in Ghana,2023-09-18,"Developing human resource for health in Ghana 18 September 2023 Accra, Ghana - From 2021 to 2023, a strategic partnership between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Kingdom Government through the Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC) helped to transform Ghana’s health workforce to better contribute to the attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) through the health workforce programme. The initiative enabled over 13 156 healthcare workers, including 5797 females across the country to benefit from improved capacity to be able to respond to emerging health challenges and help to build a resilient health system towards the attainment of UHC. “Our partnership with the UK-DHSC on this project is a reflection of our shared belief that qualified health workers are the foundation for the delivery of quality health services,” said the WHO Representative to Ghana, Prof Francis Kasolo during a closeout meeting with partners to mark the end of the programme. “The success of the programme has demonstrated that we can achieve so much more through partnership”. Speaking on behalf of UK-DHSC, Health Advisor at the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, Uzo Gilpin commended WHO for mobilizing and coordinating partners from different areas of health for the successful implementation of the programme and expressed the commitment of the Government of UK to continue supporting interventions for the health and wellbeing of Ghanaians. “The health workforce program has demonstrated WHO’s role in convening multiple partners and agencies towards strengthening the health workforce for better health outcomes,” she added. The Workforce Programme is particularly significant as it contributed to all of WHO’s triple billion objectives of more people benefitting from universal health coverage without financial hardship; more people better protected from health emergencies; more people enjoying better health and well-being as outlined in the Global Programme of Work (GPW13). The Programme has built the capacity of senior health managers and other healthcare workers through various components including Strengthening Human Resources for Health Systems, Public Health Surveillance, Emergency Preparedness and Response, including COVID-19 Case management, Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health and Adolescent and Youth-Friendly Health Services, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health as well as Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Training. “We are grateful to WHO and UK-DHSC for this health workforce programme that has contributed to developing agile health workers who are driving our health sector agenda,” noted the Director for Human Resources for Health at the Ministry of Health, Dr Kwesi Asabir. Some key achievements of the programme include enhanced capacity for 1028 (53% females) health workers in Point of Care Quality Improvement interventions, which is helping to improve Maternal, Newborn and Child Health in all 16 regions. The programme also improved the skills of 394 personnel (132 females) on mental health and psychosocial support, making such support available in schools, health facilities and communities. In addition to building the capacity of the health workforce, the Programme has also supported the improvement and development of about 20 national frameworks, guidance and tools on workforce management, medical practices and training in the country. For the health workers, this initiative was critical in empowering them to support quality health service delivery at all levels of care. “The health workforce programme was critical in equipping us with the skills needed to provide mental health & psychosocial support to survivors of the 2022 Appiatse explosion disaster,” says Dr Ruth Owusu-Antwi, President of the Psychiatric Association of Ghana. The Workforce Programme was implemented from September 2021 to June 2023 across in two phases, with a combined funding amounting to £3,663,918 from the United Kingdom Government through the Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The continued partnership between WHO and UK-DHSC has demonstrated the potential to put Ghana on the path to building an effective human resource for health towards the attainment of universal health coverage.

The initiative enabled over 13 156 healthcare workers, including 5797 females across the country to benefit from improved capacity to be able to respond to emerging health challenges and help to build a resilient health system towards the attainment of UHC. “Our partnership with the UK-DHSC on this project is a reflection of our shared belief that qualified health workers are the foundation for the delivery of quality health services,” said the WHO Representative to Ghana, Prof Francis Kasolo during a closeout meeting with partners to mark the end of the programme. “The success of the programme has demonstrated that we can achieve so much more through partnership”. Speaking on behalf of UK-DHSC, Health Advisor at the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, Uzo Gilpin commended WHO for mobilizing and coordinating partners from different areas of health for the successful implementation of the programme and expressed the commitment of the Government of UK to continue supporting interventions for the health and wellbeing of Ghanaians. “The health workforce program has demonstrated WHO’s role in convening multiple partners and agencies towards strengthening the health workforce for better health outcomes,” she added. The Workforce Programme is particularly significant as it contributed to all of WHO’s triple billion objectives of more people benefitting from universal health coverage without financial hardship; more people better protected from health emergencies; more people enjoying better health and well-being as outlined in the Global Programme of Work (GPW13). The Programme has built the capacity of senior health managers and other healthcare workers through various components including Strengthening Human Resources for Health Systems, Public Health Surveillance, Emergency Preparedness and Response, including COVID-19 Case management, Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health and Adolescent and Youth-Friendly Health Services, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health as well as Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Training. “We are grateful to WHO and UK-DHSC for this health workforce programme that has contributed to developing agile health workers who are driving our health sector agenda,” noted the Director for Human Resources for Health at the Ministry of Health, Dr Kwesi Asabir. Some key achievements of the programme include enhanced capacity for 1028 (53% females) health workers in Point of Care Quality Improvement interventions, which is helping to improve Maternal, Newborn and Child Health in all 16 regions. The programme also improved the skills of 394 personnel (132 females) on mental health and psychosocial support, making such support available in schools, health facilities and communities. In addition to building the capacity of the health workforce, the Programme has also supported the improvement and development of about 20 national frameworks, guidance and tools on workforce management, medical practices and training in the country. For the health workers, this initiative was critical in empowering them to support quality health service delivery at all levels of care. “The health workforce programme was critical in equipping us with the skills needed to provide mental health & psychosocial support to survivors of the 2022 Appiatse explosion disaster,” says Dr Ruth Owusu-Antwi, President of the Psychiatric Association of Ghana. The Workforce Programme was implemented from September 2021 to June 2023 across in two phases, with a combined funding amounting to £3,663,918 from the United Kingdom Government through the Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The continued partnership between WHO and UK-DHSC has demonstrated the potential to put Ghana on the path to building an effective human resource for health towards the attainment of universal health coverage.

Sierra Leone’s determination to stem maternal and child mortality,2023-09-05,"Sierra Leone’s determination to stem maternal and child mortality 05 September 2023 Freetown ‒ Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, with 717 mothers dying annually for every 100 000 live births as of 2019 (DHS, 2019). One of the primary contributing factors is delayed first visits to health facilities by mothers-to-be. Provision of quality preconception, antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care to all mothers in also inequitable. High out-of-pocket expenditure for accessing basic care, as well as inadequate delivery of patient-centered care at both primary and secondary levels, compound the challenges. Dr Austin Demby, Sierra Leone’s Minister of Health and Sanitation, has appealed to world leaders to support the nation in its efforts to reduce maternal and infant mortality, saying that “every case of maternal mortality constitutes an emergency” for his Ministry. “Every case of pregnancy counts just like every case of Ebola Virus Disease counts. We want to apply the same principle in counting every pregnancy and tracking it,” he says, adding that despite the challenges, notable progress. WHO is coordinating with other UN agencies and partners to offer strategic support to the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS). WHO provided technical and financial support to develop the national Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health Strategy, and supported the adaptation and roll out of Integrated the Obstetric Care Guideline, including preconception care, WHO antenatal care (ANC) recommendations, and intrapartum and post-natal care. Technical support provided by WHO was instrumental in the development and roll out of safe abortion and post-abortion care guidelines, including self-care intervention for Reproductive maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH). WHO also provided medical equipment and supplies, technically supported the review and updating of guidelines and trained health workers on their use, which improved access to quality emergency obstetric care. WHO has also been supporting the Health Ministry to strengthen the system for maternal death notification, investigation and response (MPDSR), including the development of the Safe motherhood and reproductive health bill, which is currently in Parliament for enactment. There are also ongoing efforts to build resilient and stronger health systems through transforming existing Hospitals and Peripheral Health Units (PHUs), capacitating them to offer comprehensive patient-centered quality services across the life stages and continuum of care, availing and retaining competent and skilled health personnel, and empowering communities, women and girls, improving healthcare infrastructure, and addressing health financing mechanisms, among others. These combined efforts and ongoing comprehensive measures have yielded positive results. To date, many women within the community seek health care services consistently throughout all stages of pregnancy, with more than 80% of deliveries taking place in health care facilities by skilled birth attendants. This is up from 54% in 2010. Sustaining and further expanding these initiatives will have a positive impact on maternal and child health, fostering healthier communities in the longer term.
